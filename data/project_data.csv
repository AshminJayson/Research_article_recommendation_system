presented for the production of massive photon pairs at hadron colliders. All
next-to-leading order perturbative contributions from quark-antiquark,
gluon-(anti)quark, and gluon-gluon subprocesses are included, as well as
all-orders resummation of initial-state gluon radiation valid at
next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. The region of phase space is
specified in which the calculation is most reliable. Good agreement is
demonstrated with data from the Fermilab Tevatron, and predictions are made for
more detailed tests with CDF and DO data. Predictions are shown for
distributions of diphoton pairs produced at the energy of the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC). Distributions of the diphoton pairs from the decay of a Higgs
boson are contrasted with those produced from QCD processes at the LHC, showing
that enhanced sensitivity to the signal can be obtained with judicious
selection of events.

  fluid model","23 pages, 3 figures",,,,physics.gen-ph,,"  The evolution of Earth-Moon system is described by the dark matter field
fluid model proposed in the Meeting of Division of Particle and Field 2004,
American Physical Society. The current behavior of the Earth-Moon system agrees
with this model very well and the general pattern of the evolution of the
Moon-Earth system described by this model agrees with geological and fossil
evidence. The closest distance of the Moon to Earth was about 259000 km at 4.5
billion years ago, which is far beyond the Roche's limit. The result suggests
that the tidal friction may not be the primary cause for the evolution of the
Earth-Moon system. The average dark matter field fluid constant derived from
Earth-Moon system data is 4.39 x 10^(-22) s^(-1)m^(-1). This model predicts
that the Mars's rotation is also slowing with the angular acceleration rate
about -4.38 x 10^(-22) rad s^(-2).

wave function is examined for its bosonic characters, which is quantified by
the correction of Bose enhancement factor associated with the creation and
annihilation composite particle operators. An example is given for a
three-dimensional uniform gas. Two definitions of Cooper pair wave function are
examined. One of which is chosen to reflect the off-diagonal long range order
(ODLRO). Another one corresponds to a pair projection of a BCS state. On the
side with negative scattering length, we found that paired atoms described by
ODLRO are more bosonic than the pair projected definition. It is also found
that at $(k_F a)^{-1} \ge 1$, both definitions give similar results, where more
than 90% of the atoms occupy the corresponding molecular condensates.

different aspects of the relation between the ordinary Schroedinger theory and

the polymer quantum mechanics starting from the ordinary Schroedinger theory
and show that the polymer description arises as an appropriate limit. In the
second part we consider the continuum limit of this theory, namely, the reverse
process in which one starts from the discrete theory and tries to recover back
the ordinary Schroedinger quantum mechanics. We consider several examples of
interest, including the harmonic oscillator, the free particle and a simple

applications in dynamic loading. Numerical methods were devised to calculate
response to shock and ramp compression, and ramp decompression, generalizing
previous solutions for scalar equations of state. The numerical methods were
found to be flexible and robust, and matched analytic results to a high
accuracy. The basic ramp and shock solution methods were coupled to solve for
composite deformation paths, such as shock-induced impacts, and shock
interactions with a planar interface between different materials. These
calculations capture much of the physics of typical material dynamics
experiments, without requiring spatially-resolving simulations. Example
calculations were made of loading histories in metals, illustrating the effects
of plastic work on the temperatures induced in quasi-isentropic and
shock-release experiments, and the effect of a phase transition.

observations of the Serpens star-forming region. In particular we present a set
of criteria for isolating bona fide young stellar objects, YSO's, from the
extensive background contamination by extra-galactic objects. We then discuss
the properties of the resulting high confidence set of YSO's. We find 235 such
objects in the 0.85 deg^2 field that was covered with both IRAC and MIPS. An
additional set of 51 lower confidence YSO's outside this area is identified
from the MIPS data combined with 2MASS photometry. We describe two sets of
results, color-color diagrams to compare our observed source properties with
those of theoretical models for star/disk/envelope systems and our own modeling
of the subset of our objects that appear to be star+disks. These objects
exhibit a very wide range of disk properties, from many that can be fit with
actively accreting disks to some with both passive disks and even possibly
debris disks. We find that the luminosity function of YSO's in Serpens extends
down to at least a few x .001 Lsun or lower for an assumed distance of 260 pc.
The lower limit may be set by our inability to distinguish YSO's from
extra-galactic sources more than by the lack of YSO's at very low luminosities.
A spatial clustering analysis shows that the nominally less-evolved YSO's are
more highly clustered than the later stages and that the background
extra-galactic population can be fit by the same two-point correlation function
as seen in other extra-galactic studies. We also present a table of matches
between several previous infrared and X-ray studies of the Serpens YSO
population and our Spitzer data set.

in quiescence during 1991 and 2001 are presented. Spin-modulated radial
velocities consistent with an outer disc origin were detected for the first
time in an IP. The spin pulsation was modulated with velocities near ~500-600
km/s. These velocities are consistent with those of material circulating at the
outer edge of the accretion disc, suggesting corotation of the accretion
curtain with material near the Roche lobe radius. Furthermore, spin Doppler
tomograms have revealed evidence of the accretion curtain emission extending
from velocities of ~500 km/s to ~1000 km/s. These findings have confirmed the
theoretical model predictions of King & Wynn (1999), Belle et al. (2002) and
Norton et al. (2004) for EX Hya, which predict large accretion curtains that
extend to a distance close to the Roche lobe radius in this system. Evidence
for overflow stream of material falling onto the magnetosphere was observed,
confirming the result of Belle et al. (2005) that disc overflow in EX Hya is
present during quiescence as well as outburst. It appears that the hbeta and
hgamma spin radial velocities originated from the rotation of the funnel at the
outer disc edge, while those of halpha were produced due to the flow of
material along the field lines far from the white dwarf (narrow component) and
close to the white dwarf (broad-base component), in agreement with the
accretion curtain model.

equations with non-commutative vector fields whose solution evolves on a smooth

along the manifold, we pull back the stochastic flow on the manifold to the Lie
group via the action, and subsequently pull back the flow to the corresponding
Lie algebra via the exponential map. We construct an approximation to the
stochastic flow in the Lie algebra via closed operations and then push back to
the Lie group and then to the manifold, thus ensuring our approximation lies in
the manifold. We call such schemes stochastic Munthe-Kaas methods after their
deterministic counterparts. We also present stochastic Lie group integration
schemes based on Castell--Gaines methods. These involve using an underlying
ordinary differential integrator to approximate the flow generated by a
truncated stochastic exponential Lie series. They become stochastic Lie group
integrator schemes if we use Munthe-Kaas methods as the underlying ordinary
differential integrator. Further, we show that some Castell--Gaines methods are
uniformly more accurate than the corresponding stochastic Taylor schemes.

gas, and thus will have the potential of distinguishing between rival models of
the solar atmosphere. Thus, initial results obtained from the observations of
the quiet Sun at 3.5 mm with the BIMA array (resolution of 12 arcsec) reveal
significant oscillations with amplitudes of 50-150 K and frequencies of 1.5-8
mHz with a tendency toward short-period oscillations in internetwork and longer
periods in network regions. However higher spatial resolution, such as that
provided by ALMA, is required for a clean separation between the features
within the solar atmosphere and for an adequate comparison with the output of
the comprehensive dynamic simulations.

the confinement decreases the amplitude of dynamic magnetization near the

magnetization takes place at the edges.
  In the nonlinear regime a new stable spin wave packet propagating along a
waveguide structure, for which both transversal instability and interaction
with the side walls of the waveguide are important was observed. The
experiments and a numerical simulation of the pulse evolution show that the

significantly smaller for cubically than for non-cubically shaped scatterers.
Therefore, for small d errors for cubically shaped particles are much smaller
than for non-cubically shaped. The relative importance of the linear term
decreases with increasing size, hence convergence of DDA for large enough
scatterers is quadratic in the common range of d. Extensive numerical
simulations were carried out for a wide range of d. Finally we discuss a number
of new developments in DDA and their consequences for convergence.

production and accurate estimate of introduced artificial dissipation are
possible. The constructed limiters are tested on classical numerical examples:
1D athermal shock tubes with an initial density ratio 1:2 and the 2D lid-driven
cavity for Reynolds numbers Re between 2000 and 7500 on a coarse 100*100 grid.

plasmas (solar wind, interstellar medium, galaxy clusters, accretion disks).
The key assumptions are that the turbulence is anisotropic with respect to the
mean magnetic field and frequencies are low compared to the ion cyclotron
frequency. The energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be converted
into heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. A KINETIC
CASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space and
velocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each of
the physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematically
reduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the ""inertial range"" above the
ion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenic
fluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisional
and collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations,
which obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associated
with the Alfvenic component. In the ""dissipation range"" between the ion and
electron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave
(KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passive
phase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings the
energy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionless
wave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in the
phase space and leads to ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly damped at the
electron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. Kolmogorov-style scaling
relations are derived for these cascades. Astrophysical and space-physical
applications are discussed in detail.

periodic waves over a gradual slope with bottom friction in the framework of a
variable-coefficient Korteweg-de Vries equation. We use the Whitham averaging
method, using a recent development of this theory for perturbed integrable
equations. This general approach enables us not only to improve known results
on the adiabatic evolution of isolated solitary waves and periodic wave trains
in the presence of variable topography and bottom friction, modeled by the
Chezy law, but also importantly, to study the effects of these factors on the
propagation of undular bores, which are essentially unsteady in the system
under consideration. In particular, it is shown that the combined action of
variable topography and bottom friction generally imposes certain global
restrictions on the undular bore propagation so that the evolution of the
leading solitary wave can be substantially different from that of an isolated
solitary wave with the same initial amplitude. This non-local effect is due to
nonlinear wave interactions within the undular bore and can lead to an
additional solitary wave amplitude growth, which cannot be predicted in the
framework of the traditional adiabatic approach to the propagation of solitary
waves in slowly varying media.

a sensor antenna and a general regression neural network, which solves the
location problem based on learning from examples. Locator performance was
tested on different test specimens. Tests have shown that the accuracy of
location depends on sound velocity and attenuation in the specimen, the
dimensions of the tested area, and the properties of stored data. The location
accuracy achieved by the intelligent locator is comparable to that obtained by
the conventional triangulation method, while the applicability of the
intelligent locator is more general since analysis of sonic ray paths is
avoided. This is a promising method for non-destructive testing of aircraft
frame structures by the acoustic emission method.

  Acoustic emission (AE) analysis is used for characterization and location of
developing defects in materials. AE sources often generate a mixture of various
statistically independent signals. A difficult problem of AE analysis is
separation and characterization of signal components when the signals from
various sources and the mode of mixing are unknown. Recently, blind source
separation (BSS) by independent component analysis (ICA) has been used to solve
these problems. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the applicability
of ICA to locate two independent simultaneously active acoustic emission
sources on an aluminum band specimen. The method is promising for
non-destructive testing of aircraft frame structures by acoustic emission
analysis.

curvature, of $p$-scalar curvature, of $s$-$ps$-curvature. The global
definitions of these special Finsler manifolds are introduced. Various
relationships between the different types of the considered special Finsler
manifolds are found. Many local results, known in the literature, are proved
globally and several new results are obtained. As a by-product, interesting
identities and properties concerning the torsion tensor fields and the
curvature tensor fields are deduced. Although our investigation is entirely
global, we provide; for comparison reasons, an appendix presenting a local
counterpart of our global approach and the local definitions of the special
Finsler spaces considered.

interlayer binding and thus a consistent account of the nonlocal dispersive
interactions. This is included seamlessly with ordinary DFT by a van der Waals
density functional (vdW-DF) approach [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 246401 (2004)]. The
use of the vdW-DF is found to stabilize the graphite crystal, with crystal
parameters in fair agreement with experiments. For graphite and
potassium-intercalated graphite structural parameters such as binding
separation, layer binding energy, formation energy, and bulk modulus are
reported. Also the adsorption and sub-surface potassium absorption energies are
reported. The vdW-DF description, compared with the traditional semilocal

an orbit indistinguishable from circular, $e=0.012 \pm 0.021$. We demonstrate
generally that the surface gravity of the secondary star in a single-lined
binary undergoing total eclipses can be derived from characteristics of the
light curve and spectroscopic orbit. This constrains the secondary to a unique
line in the mass-radius diagram with $M/R^2$ = constant. For HAT-TR-205-013, we
assume the orbit has been tidally circularized, and that the primary's rotation
has been synchronized and aligned with the orbital axis. Our observed line
broadening, $V_{\rm rot} \sin i_{\rm rot} = 28.9 \pm 1.0$ \kms, gives a primary
radius of $R_{\rm A} = 1.28 \pm 0.04$ \rsun. Our light curve analysis leads to
the radius of the secondary, $R_{\rm B} = 0.167 \pm 0.006$ \rsun, and the
semimajor axis of the orbit, $a = 7.54 \pm 0.30 \rsun = 0.0351 \pm 0.0014$ AU.
Our single-lined spectroscopic orbit and the semimajor axis then yield the
individual masses, $M_{\rm B} = 0.124 \pm 0.010$ \msun and $M_{\rm A} = 1.04

mass-radius models from the Lyon group, consistent with results from
double-lined eclipsing binaries. The method we describe offers the opportunity
to study the very low end of the stellar mass-radius relation.

Lagrangian densities of the four (3 + 1)-dimensional (4D) (non-)Abelian 1-form

we provide the geometrical interpretations for (i) the above nilpotent symmetry
invariance, and (ii) the above Lagrangian densities, in the language of the
specific quantities defined in the domain of the above superfield formalism.
Some of the subtle points, connected with the 4D (non-)Abelian 1-form gauge
theories, are clarified within the framework of the above superfield formalism
where the 4D ordinary gauge theories are considered on the (4, 2)-dimensional
supermanifold parametrized by the four spacetime coordinates x^\mu (with \mu =
0, 1, 2, 3) and a pair of Grassmannian variables \theta and \bar\theta. One of
the key results of our present investigation is a great deal of simplification
in the geometrical understanding of the nilpotent (anti-)BRST symmetry
invariance.

infinite sequence of parameters. A distinguished basis of such a ring is
comprised by analogues of the Schur functions. The corresponding structure
coefficients are polynomials in the parameters which we call the
Littlewood-Richardson polynomials. We give a combinatorial rule for their
calculation by modifying an earlier result of B. Sagan and the author. The new
rule provides a formula for these polynomials which is manifestly positive in
the sense of W. Graham. We apply this formula for the calculation of the
product of equivariant Schubert classes on Grassmannians which implies a
stability property of the structure coefficients. The first manifestly positive
formula for such an expansion was given by A. Knutson and T. Tao by using
combinatorics of puzzles while the stability property was not apparent from
that formula. We also use the Littlewood-Richardson polynomials to describe the
multiplication rule in the algebra of the Casimir elements for the general
linear Lie algebra in the basis of the quantum immanants constructed by A.
Okounkov and G. Olshanski.

nanostructured optoelectronic and electronic devices such as lasers,
photodetectors and nanoscale logic. Spatial order and size order of SAQDs are
important to the development of usable devices. It is likely that these two
types of order are strongly linked; thus, a study of spatial order will also
have strong implications for size order. Here a study of spatial order is
undertaken using a linear analysis of a commonly used model of SAQD formation
based on surface diffusion. Analytic formulas for film-height correlation
functions are found that characterize quantum dot spatial order and
corresponding correlation lengths that quantify order. Initial atomic-scale
random fluctuations result in relatively small correlation lengths (about two
dots) when the effect of a wetting potential is negligible; however, the
correlation lengths diverge when SAQDs are allowed to form at a near-critical
film height. The present work reinforces previous findings about anisotropy and
SAQD order and presents as explicit and transparent mechanism for ordering with
corresponding analytic equations. In addition, SAQD formation is by its nature
a stochastic process, and various mathematical aspects regarding statistical
analysis of SAQD formation and order are presented.

704.0069,John Robertson,John W. Robertson,Dynamical Objects for Cohomologically Expanding Maps,38 pages,,,,math.DS,,"  The goal of this paper is to construct invariant dynamical objects for a (not
necessarily invertible) smooth self map of a compact manifold. We prove a
result that takes advantage of differences in rates of expansion in the terms
of a sheaf cohomological long exact sequence to create unique lifts of finite
dimensional invariant subspaces of one term of the sequence to invariant
subspaces of the preceding term. This allows us to take invariant cohomological
classes and under the right circumstances construct unique currents of a given
type, including unique measures of a given type, that represent those classes
and are invariant under pullback. A dynamically interesting self map may have a
plethora of invariant measures, so the uniquess of the constructed currents is
important. It means that if local growth is not too big compared to the growth
rate of the cohomological class then the expanding cohomological class gives
sufficient ""marching orders"" to the system to prohibit the formation of any
other such invariant current of the same type (say from some local dynamical
subsystem). Because we use subsheaves of the sheaf of currents we give
conditions under which a subsheaf will have the same cohomology as the sheaf
containing it. Using a smoothing argument this allows us to show that the sheaf
cohomology of the currents under consideration can be canonically identified
with the deRham cohomology groups. Our main theorem can be applied in both the
smooth and holomorphic setting.

  Algebra in Scientific Computing, CASC 2007",,,,math-ph math.MP,,"  In present paper we propose seemingly new method for finding solutions of
some types of nonlinear PDEs in closed form. The method is based on
decomposition of nonlinear operators on sequence of operators of lower orders.
It is shown that decomposition process can be done by iterative procedure(s),
each step of which is reduced to solution of some auxiliary PDEs system(s) for
one dependent variable. Moreover, we find on this way the explicit expression
of the first-order PDE(s) for first integral of decomposable initial PDE.
Remarkably that this first-order PDE is linear if initial PDE is linear in its
highest derivatives.
  The developed method is implemented in Maple procedure, which can really
solve many of different order PDEs with different number of independent
variables. Examples of PDEs with calculated their general solutions demonstrate
a potential of the method for automatic solving of nonlinear PDEs.

depends on cluster half-mass density (rho_h) in the sense that the turnover
mass M_TO increases with rho_h while the width of the GCMF decreases. We argue
that this is the expected signature of the slow erosion of a mass function that
initially rose towards low masses, predominantly through cluster evaporation
driven by internal two-body relaxation. We find excellent agreement between the
observed GCMF -- including its dependence on internal density rho_h, central
concentration c, and Galactocentric distance r_gc -- and a simple model in
which the relaxation-driven mass-loss rates of clusters are approximated by
-dM/dt = mu_ev ~ rho_h^{1/2}. In particular, we recover the well-known
insensitivity of M_TO to r_gc. This feature does not derive from a literal
``universality'' of the GCMF turnover mass, but rather from a significant
variation of M_TO with rho_h -- the expected outcome of relaxation-driven
cluster disruption -- plus significant scatter in rho_h as a function of r_gc.
Our conclusions are the same if the evaporation rates are assumed to depend
instead on the mean volume or surface densities of clusters inside their tidal
radii, as mu_ev ~ rho_t^{1/2} or mu_ev ~ Sigma_t^{3/4} -- alternative
prescriptions that are physically motivated but involve cluster properties
(rho_t and Sigma_t) that are not as well defined or as readily observable as
rho_h. In all cases, the normalization of mu_ev required to fit the GCMF
implies cluster lifetimes that are within the range of standard values
(although falling towards the low end of this range). Our analysis does not
depend on any assumptions or information about velocity anisotropy in the
globular cluster system.

with V_{DM}=3000km/s, and the ""bullet"" X-ray gas can move with
V_{gas}=4200km/s. These are nearly the {\it maximum speeds} that are
accelerable by the gravity of two truncated CDM halos in a Hubble time even
without the ram pressure. Consistency breaks down if one adopts higher end of
the error bars for the bullet gas speed (5000-5400km/s), and the bullet gas
would not be bound by the sub-cluster halo for the Hubble time. Models with
V_{DM}~ 4500km/s ~ V_{gas} would invoke unrealistic large amount M_{CDM}=7x

  Large Balls","slightly expanded and polished new version, 57 pages, 2 figures",,,,math.GR math.DG,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  We get asymptotics for the volume of large balls in an arbitrary locally
compact group G with polynomial growth. This is done via a study of the
geometry of G and a generalization of P. Pansu's thesis. In particular, we show
that any such G is weakly commensurable to some simply connected solvable Lie
group S, the Lie shadow of G. We also show that large balls in G have an
asymptotic shape, i.e. after a suitable renormalization, they converge to a
limiting compact set which can be interpreted geometrically. We then discuss
the speed of convergence, treat some examples and give an application to
ergodic theory. We also answer a question of Burago about left invariant
metrics and recover some results of Stoll on the irrationality of growth series
of nilpotent groups.

inequalities $||| f(A)+f(B) ||| \ge ||| f(A+B) |||$ and $||| g(A)+g(B) ||| \le
||| g(A+B) |||$, for any unitarily invariant norm, and for any non-negative
operator monotone $f$ on $[0,\infty)$ with inverse function $g$. These
inequalities have very recently been generalised to non-negative concave
functions $f$ and non-negative convex functions $g$, by Bourin and Uchiyama,
and Kosem, respectively.
  In this paper we consider the related question whether the inequalities $|||
f(A)-f(B) ||| \le ||| f(|A-B|) |||$, and $||| g(A)-g(B) ||| \ge ||| g(|A-B|)
|||$, obtained by Ando, for operator monotone $f$ with inverse $g$, also have a
similar generalisation to non-negative concave $f$ and convex $g$. We answer
exactly this question, in the negative for general matrices, and affirmatively
in the special case when $A\ge ||B||$.
  In the course of this work, we introduce the novel notion of $Y$-dominated
majorisation between the spectra of two Hermitian matrices, where $Y$ is itself
a Hermitian matrix, and prove a certain property of this relation that allows
to strengthen the results of Bourin-Uchiyama and Kosem, mentioned above.

understood as a handle attachment. It has been found that there are certain
constraints on the nature of black hole topological evolution: (i) There are n
kinds of handle attachments in (n+1)-dimensional black hole space-times. (ii)
Handles are further classified as either of black or white type, and only black
handles appear in real black hole space-times. (iii) The spatial section of an
exterior of the black hole region is always connected. As a corollary, it is
shown that the formation of a black hole with an S**(n-2) x S**1 horizon from
that with an S**(n-1) horizon must be non-axisymmetric in asymptotically flat

twist-four contributions from quark-quark (antiquark) rescattering also exhibit
the Landau-Pomeranchuck-Midgal (LPM) interference feature similar to gluon
bremsstrahlung induced by multiple parton scattering. Compared to quark-gluon
scattering, the modification, which is dominated by $t$-channel quark-quark
(antiquark) scattering, is only smaller by a factor of $C_F/C_A=4/9$ times the
ratio of quark and gluon distributions in the medium. Such a modification is
not negligible for realistic kinematics and finite medium size. The
modifications to quark (antiquark) fragmentation functions from quark-antiquark
annihilation processes are shown to be determined by the antiquark (quark)
distribution density in the medium. The asymmetry in quark and antiquark
distributions in nuclei will lead to different modifications of quark and
antiquark fragmentation functions inside a nucleus, which qualitatively
explains the experimentally observed flavor dependence of the leading hadron
suppression in semi-inclusive DIS off nuclear targets. The quark-antiquark
annihilation processes also mix quark and gluon fragmentation functions in the
large fractional momentum region, leading to a flavor dependence of jet
quenching in heavy-ion collisions.

strong fluctuations in the dimer background, reflected in the presence of a
low-energy singlet mode, with a simultaneous rise in the triplet quasiparticle

which goes beyond mean-field theory in terms of the triplet excitations, the

Phenomena of branching and long-time refractority (absence of the reaction on
the external pulses) for deterministic chaotic and regular processes of SE were
observed in experiments with various levels of electromagnetic pumping. At the
pumping level growth, the clearly depined increasing of the number of
coexisting SE states has been observed both in real physical experiments and in
computer simulations. This confirms the analytical estimations of the branching
density in the phase space. The nature of the refractority of SE pulses is
closely connected with the pointed branching and reflects the crises of strange
attractors, i.e. their collisions with unstable periodic components of the
higher branches of SE states in the nonautonomous microwave phonon laser.

a scaling behavior in the framework of quasi-two-dimension (quasi-2D) vortex
glass theory. However, at \mu0 H >= 5T, a finite dissipation was observed down
to the lowest temperature here, T=1.7K, and the I-V isotherms did not scale in
terms of any known scaling law, of any dimensionality. We suggest that this may
be caused by a mixture of \sigma band vortices and \pi band quasiparticles.
Interestingly, the I-V curves at zero magnetic field can still be scaled
according to the quasi-2D vortex glass formalism, indicating an equivalent
effect of self-field due to persistent current and applied magnetic field.

  Aims. To provide the community with an online repository of X-ray light
curves obtained with Swift. The light curves should be of the quality expected
of published data, but automatically created and updated so as to be
self-consistent and rapidly available. Methods. We have produced a suite of
programs which automatically generates Swift/XRT light curves of GRBs. Effects
of the damage to the CCD, automatic readout-mode switching and pile-up are
appropriately handled, and the data are binned with variable bin durations, as
necessary for a fading source.
  Results. The light curve repository website
(http://www.swift.ac.uk/xrt_curves) contains light curves, hardness ratios and
deep images for every GRB which Swift's XRT has observed. When new GRBs are
detected, light curves are created and updated within minutes of the data
arriving at the UK Swift Science Data Centre.

  suggestion, typos corrected. Accepted for publication in PRD","Phys.Rev.D76:044007,2007",10.1103/PhysRevD.76.044007,,gr-qc astro-ph,,"  We have performed a detailed analysis of orbital motion in the vicinity of a
nearly extremal Kerr black hole. For very rapidly rotating black holes (spin
a=J/M>0.9524M) we have found a class of very strong field eccentric orbits
whose angular momentum L_z increases with the orbit's inclination with respect
to the equatorial plane, while keeping latus rectum and eccentricity fixed.
This behavior is in contrast with Newtonian intuition, and is in fact opposite
to the ""normal"" behavior of black hole orbits. Such behavior was noted
previously for circular orbits; since it only applies to orbits very close to
the black hole, they were named ""nearly horizon-skimming orbits"". Our analysis
generalizes this result, mapping out the full generic (inclined and eccentric)
family of nearly horizon-skimming orbits. The earlier work on circular orbits
reported that, under gravitational radiation emission, nearly horizon-skimming
orbits tend to evolve to smaller orbit inclination, toward prograde equatorial
configuration. Normal orbits, by contrast, always demonstrate slowly growing
orbit inclination (orbits evolve toward the retrograde equatorial
configuration). Using up-to-date Teukolsky-fluxes, we have concluded that the
earlier result was incorrect: all circular orbits, including nearly
horizon-skimming ones, exhibit growing orbit inclination. Using kludge fluxes
based on a Post-Newtonian expansion corrected with fits to circular and to
equatorial Teukolsky-fluxes, we argue that the inclination grows also for
eccentric nearly horizon-skimming orbits. We also find that the inclination
change is, in any case, very small. As such, we conclude that these orbits are
not likely to have a clear and peculiar imprint on the gravitational waveforms
expected to be measured by the space-based detector LISA.

processes in primordial binaries is required to reproduce the observed radial
distribution. A candidate BSS has been detected beyond the cluster tidal

exactly the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy S_{BH}, whereas the subleading term
behaves as ln S_{BH}. This subleading term has the universal form typical for
the entanglement entropy of physical systems described by effective conformal
fields theories (e.g. one-dimensional statistical models at the critical
point). The well-known form of the entanglement entropy for a two-dimensional
conformal field theory is obtained as analytic continuation of our result and
is related with the entanglement entropy of a black hole with negative mass.

integrate out only a single pair of conjugated modes with wave vectors +/- q.
Then we are looking for the RG equation which would describe the transformation
of the Hamiltonian under the integration over a shell Lambda - d Lambda < k <
Lambda, where d Lambda -> 0. We show that the known Wegner--Houghton equation
is consistent with the assumption of a simple superposition of the integration
results for +/- q. The renormalized action can be expanded in powers of the
phi^4 coupling constant u in the high temperature phase at u -> 0. We compare
the expansion coefficients with those exactly calculated by the diagrammatic
perturbative method, and find some inconsistency. It causes a question in which
sense the Wegner-Houghton equation is really exact.

flow and hence playing a key role in turbulence. The fluid rotation associated
with a vortex can be parameterized by the circulation $\Gamma=\oint {\rm d}{\bf
r}\cdot{\bf v}({\bf r})$ about the vortex, where ${\bf v}({\bf r})$ is the
fluid velocity field. While classical vortices can take any value of
circulation, superfluids are irrotational, and any rotation or angular momentum
is constrained to occur through vortices with quantized circulation. Quantized
vortices also play a key role in the dissipation of transport in superfluids.
In BECs quantized vortices have been observed in several forms, including
single vortices, vortex lattices, and vortex pairs and rings. The recent
observation of quantized vortices in a fermionic gas was taken as a clear
signature of the underlying condensation and superfluidity of fermion pairs. In
addition to BECs, quantized vortices also occur in superfluid Helium, nonlinear
optics, and type-II superconductors.

interaction, the $g$-factor fluctuations, the direct spin-phonon coupling due
to the phonon-induced strain, and the coaction of the
electron--bulk/surface-phonon interaction together with the hyperfine
interaction are included. The relative contributions from these spin
decoherence mechanisms are compared in detail. In our calculation, the
spin-orbit coupling is included in each mechanism and is shown to have marked
effect in most cases. The equation-of-motion approach is applied in studying
both the spin relaxation time $T_1$ and the spin dephasing time $T_2$, either
in Markovian or in non-Markovian limit. When many levels are involved at finite
temperature, we demonstrate how to obtain the spin relaxation time from the
Fermi Golden rule in the limit of weak spin-orbit coupling. However, at high
temperature and/or for large spin-orbit coupling, one has to use the
equation-of-motion approach when many levels are involved. Moreover, spin
dephasing can be much more efficient than spin relaxation at high temperature,
though the two only differs by a factor of two at low temperature.

chains are investigated in three different cases: (a) J1, J2, J3>0
(frustrated); (b) J1, J3<0, J2>0 (frustrated); and (c) J1, J2>0, J3<0
(non-frustrated). The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) technique is
invoked to study the properties of the system in the ground state, while the
transfer matrix renormalization group (TMRG) technique is applied to explore
the thermodynamic properties. The local magnetic moments, spin correlation
functions, and static structure factors are discussed in the ground state for
the three cases. It is shown that the static structure factor S(q) shows peaks
at wavevectors $q=a\pi /3$ (a=0,1,2,3,4,5) for different couplings in a zero
magnetic field, which, however in the magnetic fields where the magnetization
plateau with m=1/6 pertains, exhibits the peaks only at q=0, $2\pi /3$ and
$4\pi /3$, which are found to be couplings-independent. The DMRG results of the
zero-field static structure factor can be nicely fitted by a linear
superposition of six modes, where two fitting equations are proposed. It is
observed that the six modes are closely related to the low-lying excitations of
the system. At finite temperatures, the double-peak structures of the
susceptibility and specific heat against temperature are obtained, where the
peak positions and heights are found to depend on the competition of the
couplings. It is also uncovered that the XXZ anisotropy of F and AF couplings
leads the system of case (c) to display quite different behaviors. In addition,
the experimental data of the susceptibility, specific heat and magnetization
for the compound Cu$_{3}$(CO$_{3}$)$_{2}$(OH)$_{2}$ are fairly compared with
our TMRG results.

and y is treated. The joint, the marginal and the conditional probability
density functions (PDF) are expressed by given data over an estimator whose
kernel is the instrument scattering function. As an optimal estimator of yo(x)
the conditional average is proposed. The analysis of its properties is based
upon a new definition of prediction quality. The joint experimental information
and the redundancy of joint measurements are expressed by the relative entropy.
With the number of experiments the redundancy on average increases, while the
experimental information converges to a certain limit value. The difference
between this limit value and the experimental information at a finite number of
data represents the discrepancy between the experimentally determined and the
true properties of the phenomenon. The sum of the discrepancy measure and the
redundancy is utilized as a cost function. By its minimum a reasonable number
of data for the extraction of the law yo(x) is specified. The mutual
information is defined by the marginal and the conditional PDFs of the
variables. The ratio between mutual information and marginal information is
used to indicate which variable is the independent one. The properties of the
introduced statistics are demonstrated on deterministically and randomly
related variables.

simple prescription for restoring both local and global particle-number

correlated systems and for the density response function are derived and it is
shown that the semiclassical analogous of the quantum single--particle spectrum
has an excitation gap of $2\Delta$, in agreement with the quantum result. The

the fresh oxygen released during massive supernova explosions is confined
within the hot superbubbles as long as supernovae continue to explode. Only
after the last massive supernova explosion, the metal-rich gas starts cooling
down and falls on the galaxy within metal-rich droplets. Full mixing of these
metal-rich droplets and the ISM occurs during photoionization by the next
generations of massive stars. During this process, the metal-rich droplets give
rise to strong recombination lines of the metals, leading to the observed

Gruneisen parameters of the soft phonons. The phonon frequencies and eigen
vectors obtained from ab-initio calculations are used for the assignment of the
observed phonon spectra. Out of the eleven zone-centre optical modes, six modes
exhibit negative Gruneisen parameter. The calculations suggest that the soft
phonons correspond to the librational and translational modes of CN rigid unit,
with librational modes contributing more to thermal expansion. A rapid
disordering of the lattice is found above 1.6 GPa from X-ray diffraction.

704.0162,Igor Grabec,I. Grabec,Estimation of experimental data redundancy and related statistics,"7 pages, 5 eps figures, uses svjour.cls",,,,physics.data-an physics.comp-ph,,"  Redundancy of experimental data is the basic statistic from which the
complexity of a natural phenomenon and the proper number of experiments needed
for its exploration can be estimated. The redundancy is expressed by the
entropy of information pertaining to the probability density function of
experimental variables. Since the calculation of entropy is inconvenient due to
integration over a range of variables, an approximate expression for redundancy
is derived that includes only a sum over the set of experimental data about
these variables. The approximation makes feasible an efficient estimation of
the redundancy of data along with the related experimental information and
information cost function. From the experimental information the complexity of
the phenomenon can be simply estimated, while the proper number of experiments
needed for its exploration can be determined from the minimum of the cost
function. The performance of the approximate estimation of these statistics is
demonstrated on two-dimensional normally distributed random data.

704.0164,Lilia Rosati,Lilia Rosati,On smooth foliations with Morse singularities,"15 pages, 14 figures",,,,math.GT,,"  Let $M$ be a smooth manifold and let $\F$ be a codimension one, $C^\infty$
foliation on $M$, with isolated singularities of Morse type. The study and
classification of pairs $(M,\F)$ is a challenging (and difficult) problem. In
this setting, a classical result due to Reeb \cite{Reeb} states that a manifold
admitting a foliation with exactly two center-type singularities is a sphere.
In particular this is true if the foliation is given by a function. Along these
lines a result due to Eells and Kuiper \cite{Ku-Ee} classify manifolds having a
real-valued function admitting exactly three non-degenerate singular points. In
the present paper, we prove a generalization of the above mentioned results. To
do this, we first describe the possible arrangements of pairs of singularities
and the corresponding codimension one invariant sets, and then we give an
elimination procedure for suitable center-saddle and some saddle-saddle
configurations (of consecutive indices). In the second part, we investigate if
other classical results, such as Haefliger and Novikov (Compact Leaf) theorems,
proved for regular foliations, still hold true in presence of singularities. At
this purpose, in the singular set, $Sing(\F)$ of the foliation $\F$, we
consider {\em{weakly stable}} components, that we define as those components
admitting a neighborhood where all leaves are compact. If $Sing(\F)$ admits
only weakly stable components, given by smoothly embedded curves diffeomorphic
to $S^1$, we are able to extend Haefliger's theorem. Finally, the existence of
a closed curve, transverse to the foliation, leads us to state a Novikov-type
result.

allows to obtain analytic results for all these theories. This work extends the

Reparametrization Invariance proves appropriate to understand those issues. We
show that some Standard Model inspired parametrizations can be senseless or
inadequate if they go beyond the minimal Gronau and London assumptions: the
single weak phase $\alpha$ just in the $\Delta I=3/2$ amplitudes, the isospin
relations and experimental data. Beside those analyses, we extract $\alpha$
through the use of several adequate parametrizations, showing that there is no
relevant discrepancy between frequentist and bayesian results. The most
relevant information, in terms of $\alpha$, is the exclusion of values around
$\alpha\sim \pi/4$; this result is valid in the presence of arbitrary New
Physics contributions to the $\Delta I=1/2$ piece.

mainly determined by the tail of the transmission peak contributed unusually by
the perturbed lowest perturbed unoccupied molecular orbital. The calculated
on-off ratio of currents between the closed and open configurations is about
two orders of magnitude, which reproduces the essential features of the

from 300K to 900K; Young's modulus and the tensile strengths are decreasing
with increasing temperature while the Poisson ratio is increasing. At higher
temperatures, Young's modulus starts to increase while the Poisson ratio and
tensile strength decrease. In the temperature range from 1200K to 1800K, the
SWCNT is already deformed and softened. Applying strain on these deformed and
softened SWCNTs do not follow the same pattern as in the temperature range of
300K to 900K.

the two quasars whose intergalactic HeII forest has been resolved with FUSE. By
analysing the HI and the HeII opacity variations separately, no transverse
proximity effect is detected near three foreground quasars of HE2347-4342:
QSOJ23503-4328 (z=2.282, $\vartheta=3.59$ arcmin), QSOJ23500-4319 (z=2.302,
$\vartheta=8.77$ arcmin) and QSOJ23495-4338 (z=2.690, $\vartheta=16.28$
arcmin). This is primarily due to line contamination and overdensities probably
created by large-scale structure. By comparing the HI absorption and the
corresponding HeII absorption, we estimated the fluctuating spectral shape of
the extragalactic UV radiation field along this line of sight. We find that the
UV spectral shape near HE2347-4342 and in the projected vicinity of the three
foreground quasars is statistically harder than expected from UV background
models dominated by quasars. In addition, we find three highly ionised metal
line systems near the quasars. However, they do not yield further constraints
on the shape of the ionising field. We conclude that the foreground quasars
show a transverse proximity effect that is detectable as a local hardening of
the UV radiation field, although the evidence is strongest for QSOJ23495-4338.
Thus, the relative spectral hardness traces the proximity effect also in
overdense regions prohibiting the traditional detection in the HI forest.
Furthermore, we emphasise that softening of quasar radiation by radiative
transfer in the intergalactic medium is important to understand the observed
spectral shape variations. From the transverse proximity effect of
QSOJ23495-4338 we obtain a lower limit on the quasar lifetime of ~25 Myr.

Data Bank reveals several new knots which, along with previously discovered
ones, can shed light on such connections. In particular, we identify the most
complex knot discovered to date in human ubiquitin hydrolase, and suggest that
its entangled topology protects it against unfolding and degradation by the
proteasome. Knots in proteins are typically preserved across species and
sometimes even across kingdoms. However, we also identify a knot which only
appears in some transcarbamylases while being absent in homologous proteins of
similar structure. The emergence of the knot is accompanied by a shift in the
enzymatic function of the protein. We suggest that the simple insertion of a
short DNA fragment into the gene may suffice to turn an unknotted into a
knotted structure in this protein.

The SET plays a role of the fluctuating environment affecting the qubit's
parameters in a controllable way. We derive the rate equations describing
dynamics of the entire system for both weak and strong qubit-SET coupling.
Solving these equation we obtain decoherence and relaxation rates of the qubit,
as well as the spectral density of the fluctuating qubit's parameters. We found
that in the weak coupling regime the decoherence and relaxation rates are
directly related to the spectral density taken at Rabi or at zero frequency,
depending on what a particular qubit's parameters is fluctuating. This relation
holds also in the presence of weak back-action of the qubit on the fluctuating
environment. In the case of strong back-action, such simple relationship no
longer holds, even if the qubit-SET coupling is small. It does not hold either
in the strong-coupling regime, even in the absence of the back-action. In
addition, we found that our model predicts localization of the qubit in the
strong-coupling regime, resembling that of the spin-boson model.

the disordered phase their number is small. Lynch proved the conjecture only
for networks with connectivity two and non-uniform probabilities for the
Boolean functions. We show how to apply the proof to networks with arbitrary
connectivity $K$ and to random networks with biased Boolean functions. It turns
out that in these cases Lynch's parameter $\lambda$ is equivalent to the
expectation of average sensitivity of the Boolean functions used to construct
the network. Hence we can apply a known theorem for the expectation of the
average sensitivity. In order to prove the results for networks with biased
functions, we deduct the expectation of the average sensitivity when only
functions with specific connectivity and specific bias are chosen at random.

somewhat different language. We explain how to extract the type $B_n$
decomposition numbers from results of B\'ona, Bousquet, Labelle and Leroux on
map enumeration. Our formula for the type $D_n$ decomposition numbers is new.
These results are then used to determine, for a fixed positive integer $l$ and

\pi_2\le ...\le \pi_l$ in Armstrong's generalised non-crossing partitions

all known enumerative results on ordinary and generalised non-crossing
partitions via appropriate summations. Surprisingly, this result on multi-chain
enumeration is new even for the original non-crossing partitions of Kreweras.
Moreover, the result allows one to solve the problem of rank-selected chain
enumeration in the type $D_n$ generalised non-crossing partitions poset, which,
in turn, leads to a proof of Armstrong's $F=M$ Conjecture in type $D_n$.

cluster. Our Spitzer census supplemented by ground based spectra has added 42
class II T-Tauri sources to the cluster membership and identified ~20 class 0/I
protostars. The population of IC 348 likely exceeds 400 sources after
accounting statistically for unidentified diskless members. Our Spitzer census
of IC 348 reveals a population of protostars that is anti-correlated spatially
with the T-Tauri members, which comprise the centrally condensed cluster around
a B star. The protostars are instead found mostly at the cluster periphery
about 1 pc from the B star and spread out along a filamentary ridge. We find
that the star formation rate in this protostellar ridge is consistent with that
rate which built the exposed cluster while the presence of fifteen cold,
starless, millimeter cores intermingled with this protostellar population
indicates that the IC 348 nebula has yet to finish forming stars. We show that
the IC 348 cluster is of order 3-5 crossing times old, and, as evidenced by its
smooth radial profile and confirmed mass segregation, is likely relaxed. While
it seems apparent that the current cluster configuration is the result of
dynamical evolution and its primordial structure has been erased, our findings
support a model where embedded clusters are built up from numerous smaller
sub-clusters. Finally, the results of our Spitzer census indicate that the
supposition that star formation must progress rapidly in a dark cloud should
not preclude these observations that show it can be relatively long lived.

blackbody model, with photon index Gamma=1.4 and blackbody temperature kT=160
eV. For the estimated distance of 2.5 kpc, this corresponds to a 2-10 keV
luminosity of about 1.2E+32 erg/s, thus the fraction of the spin-down energy
channeled by PSR J1357-6429 into X-ray emission is one of the lowest observed.
The Chandra data confirm the positional coincidence with the radio pulsar and
allow to set an upper limit of 3E+31 erg/s on the 2-10 keV luminosity of a
compact pulsar wind nebula. We do not detect any pulsed emission from the
source and determine an upper limit of 30% for the modulation amplitude of the
X-ray emission at the radio frequency of the pulsar.

from the hot gas heated by interaction of the blast wave with the ring-like
dense circumstellar medium (CSM) that was produced by the massive progenitor's
equatorial stellar winds before the SN explosion. The blast wave is now
sweeping through dense CSM all around the inner ring, and thus SN 1987A is
rapidly brightening in soft X-rays. At the age of 20 yr (as of 2007 January),
X-ray luminosity of SN 1987A is $L_{\rm X}$ $\sim$ 2.4 $\times$ 10$^{36}$ ergs
s$^{-1}$ in the 0.5$-$10 keV band. X-ray emission is described by two-component
plane shock model with electron temperatures of $kT$ $\sim$ 0.3 and 2 keV. As
the shock front interacts with dense CSM all around the inner ring, the X-ray
remnant is now expanding at a much slower rate of $v$ $\sim$ 1400 km s$^{-1}$
than it was until 2004 ($v$ $\sim$ 6000 km s$^{-1}$).

receiver can be used to specify a transmit precoding matrix, which selectively
activates the strongest channel modes. Here we analyze the performance of
Random Vector Quantization (RVQ), in which the precoding matrix is selected
from a random codebook containing independent, isotropically distributed
entries. We assume that channel elements are i.i.d. and known to the receiver,
which relays the optimal (rate-maximizing) precoder codebook index to the
transmitter using B bits. We first derive the large system capacity of
beamforming (rank-one precoding matrix) as a function of B, where large system
refers to the limit as B and the number of transmit and receive antennas all go
to infinity with fixed ratios. With beamforming RVQ is asymptotically optimal,
i.e., no other quantization scheme can achieve a larger asymptotic rate. The
performance of RVQ is also compared with that of a simpler reduced-rank scalar
quantization scheme in which the beamformer is constrained to lie in a random
subspace. We subsequently consider a precoding matrix with arbitrary rank, and
approximate the asymptotic RVQ performance with optimal and linear receivers
(matched filter and Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE)). Numerical examples show
that these approximations accurately predict the performance of finite-size
systems of interest. Given a target spectral efficiency, numerical examples
show that the amount of feedback required by the linear MMSE receiver is only
slightly more than that required by the optimal receiver, whereas the matched
filter can require significantly more feedback.

emission from this source is heavily absorbed and has a spectrum best fit by a
power law model of photon index=2 with no evidence for a thermal component, the
X-ray emission from G328.4+0.2 comes from a region significantly smaller than
the radio emission, and that the X-ray and radio emission are significantly
offset from each other. We also present the results of a new high resolution (7
arcseconds) 1.4 GHz image of G328.4+0.2 obtained using the Australia Telescope
Compact Array, and a deep search for radio pulsations using the Parkes Radio
Telescope. We find that the radio emission has a flat spectrum, though some
areas along the eastern edge of G328.4+0.2 have a steeper radio spectral index
of ~-0.3. Additionally, we obtain a luminosity limit of the central pulsar of
L_{1400} < 30 mJy kpc^2, assuming a distance of 17 kpc. In light of these

energy loss, Cerenkov gluon radiation of fast moving particles, and conical
flow generated by hydrodynamic Mach-cone shock-waves. Three-particle
correlations have the power to distinguish the scenarios with conical emission,
conical flow and Cerenkov radiation, from other scenarios. In addition, the
dependence of the observed shapes on the $p_T$ of the associated particles can
be used to distinguish conical emission from a sonic boom (Mach-cone) and from
QCD-Cerenkov radiation. We present results from STAR on 3-particle azimuthal

Results are shown for $pp$, d+Au and high statistics Au+Au collisions at

of combinatorial backgrounds. Systematic uncertainties due to this subtraction
and the flow harmonics v2 and v4 are investigated in detail. The implications

discussed.

into account the important effect of the Point Spread Function (PSF) of the

  Briand et al (arXIv:0810.3163v1 [math.CO])",,,,cs.CC,http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/,"  This article belongs to a series on geometric complexity theory (GCT), an
approach to the P vs. NP and related problems through algebraic geometry and
representation theory. The basic principle behind this approach is called the
flip. In essence, it reduces the negative hypothesis in complexity theory (the
lower bound problems), such as the P vs. NP problem in characteristic zero, to
the positive hypothesis in complexity theory (the upper bound problems):
specifically, to showing that the problems of deciding nonvanishing of the
fundamental structural constants in representation theory and algebraic
geometry, such as the well known plethysm constants--or rather certain relaxed
forms of these decision probelms--belong to the complexity class P. In this
article, we suggest a plan for implementing the flip, i.e., for showing that
these relaxed decision problems belong to P. This is based on the reduction of
the preceding complexity-theoretic positive hypotheses to mathematical
positivity hypotheses: specifically, to showing that there exist positive
formulae--i.e. formulae with nonnegative coefficients--for the structural
constants under consideration and certain functions associated with them. These
turn out be intimately related to the similar positivity properties of the
Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and the multiplicative structural constants of the
canonical (global crystal) bases in the theory of Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum
groups. The known proofs of these positivity properties depend on the Riemann
hypothesis over finite fields and the related results. Thus the reduction here,
in conjunction with the flip, in essence, says that the validity of the P vs.
NP conjecture in characteristic zero is intimately linked to the Riemann
hypothesis over finite fields and related problems.

704.023,Rene Duffard,R. Duffard and F. Roig,Two new basaltic asteroids in the Outer Main Belt?,"13 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables",,,,astro-ph,,"  The identification of basaltic asteroids in the asteroid Main Belt and the
description of their surface mineralogy is necessary to understand the
diversity in the collection of basaltic meteorites. Basaltic asteroids can be
identified from their visible reflectance spectra and are classified as V-type
in the usual taxonomies. In this work, we report visible spectroscopic
observations of two candidate V-type asteroids, (7472) Kumakiri and (10537)
1991 RY16, located in the outer Main Belt (a > 2.85 UA). These candidate have
been previously identified by Roig and Gil-Hutton (2006, Icarus 183, 411) using
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey colors. The spectroscopic observations have been
obtained at the Calar Alto Observatory, Spain, during observational runs in
November and December 2006. The spectra of these two asteroids show the steep
slope shortwards of 0.70 microns and the deep absorption feature longwards of
0.75 microns that are characteristic of V-type asteroids. However, the presence
of a shallow but conspicuous absorption band around 0.65 microns opens some
questions about the actual mineralogy of these two asteroids. Such band has
never been observed before in basaltic asteroids with the intensity we detected
it. We discuss the possibility for this shallow absorption feature to be caused
by the presence of chromium on the asteroid surface. Our results indicate that,
together with (1459) Magnya, asteroids (7472) Kumakiri and (10537) 1991 RY16
may be the only traces of basaltic material found up to now in the outer Main
Belt.

the best determination of this quantity. To make such measurements requires
integrated luminosities of $\sim 10(60) fb^{-1}$ assuming $M_{W'}=1.5(2.5)$ TeV
and provided that the $W'$ couplings have Standard Model magnitude. This
helicity determination can be further strengthened by the use of various
discovery channel leptonic asymmetries, also measured in the same interference
regime, but with higher integrated luminosities.

  A White Paper Submitted to the NSF ExoPlanet Task Force",,,,,astro-ph,,"  The extraordinary astrometric accuracy of radio interferometry creates an
important and unique opportunity for the discovery and characterization of
exo-planets. Currently, the Very Long Baseline Array can routinely achieve
better than 100 microarcsecond accuracy, and can approach 10 microarcsecond
with careful calibration. We describe here RIPL, the Radio Interferometric
PLanet search, a new program with the VLBA and the Green Bank 100 m telescope
that will survey 29 low-mass, active stars over 3 years with sub-Jovian planet
mass sensitivity at 1 AU. An upgrade of the VLBA bandwidth will increase
astrometric accuracy by an order of magnitude. Ultimately, the colossal
collecting area of the Square Kilometer Array could push astrometric accuracy
to 1 microarcsecond, making detection and characterizaiton of Earth mass
planets possible.
  RIPL and other future radio astrometric planet searches occupy a unique
volume in planet discovery and characterization parameter space. The parameter
space of astrometric searches gives greater sensitivity to planets at large
radii than radial velocity searches. For the VLBA and the expanded VLBA, the
targets of radio astrometric surveys are by necessity nearby, low-mass, active
stars, which cannot be studied efficiently through the radial velocity method,
coronagraphy, or optical interferometry. For the SKA, detection sensitivity
will extend to solar-type stars. Planets discovered through radio astrometric
methods will be suitable for characterization through extreme adaptive optics.
  The complementarity of radio astrometric techniques with other methods
demonstrates that radio astrometry can play an important role in the roadmap
for exoplanet discovery and characterization.

approaches for the time-dependent cavity radius $R(t)$ at different solvent

collapse velocity is found to be given by the ratio of surface tension and
fluid viscosity, $v\simeq\gamma/\eta$, while the curvature correction
accelerates collapse dynamics on length scales below the equilibrium crossover
scales ($\sim$1nm). The study offers a starting point for an efficient implicit
modeling of water dynamics in aqueous nanoassembly and protein systems in

antiferromagnetic states in a strongly correlated electron system. The study is
based on dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) for the infinite dimensional
Hubbard model with antiferromagnetic symmetry breaking. Self-consistent
solutions of the DMFT equations are calculated using the numerical
renormalization group (NRG). The low energy behavior in these results is then
analyzed in terms of renormalized quasiparticles. The parameters for these
quasiparticles are calculated directly from the NRG derived self-energy, and
also from the low energy fixed point of the effective impurity. They are found
to be in good agreement. We show that the main low energy features of the $\bf
k$-resolved spectral density can be understood in terms of the quasiparticle
picture. We also find that Luttinger's theorem is satisfied for the total
electron number in the doped antiferromagnetic state.

  (Invisibility)","The presentation of the results has been simplified. Comments and
  references have been added",,,,physics.optics math-ph math.MP,,"  There is currently a great deal of interest in the theoretical and practical
possibility of cloaking objects from the observation by electromagnetic waves.
The basic idea of these invisibility devices \cite{glu1, glu2, le},\cite{pss1}
is to use anisotropic {\it transformation media} whose permittivity and
permeability $\var^{\lambda\nu}, \mu^{\lambda\nu}$, are obtained from the ones,
$\var_0^{\lambda\nu}, \mu^{\lambda\nu}_0$, of isotropic media, by singular
transformations of coordinates. In this paper we study electromagnetic cloaking
in the time-domain using the formalism of time-dependent scattering theory.
This formalism allows us to settle in an unambiguous way the mathematical
problems posed by the singularities of the inverse of the permittivity and the
permeability of the {\it transformation media} on the boundary of the cloaked
objects. We write Maxwell's equations in Schr\""odinger form with the
electromagnetic propagator playing the role of the Hamiltonian. We prove that
the electromagnetic propagator outside of the cloaked objects is essentially
self-adjoint. Moreover, the unique self-adjoint extension is unitarily
equivalent to the electromagnetic propagator in the medium
$\var_0^{\lambda\nu}, \mu^{\lambda\nu}_0$. Using this fact, and since the
coordinate transformation is the identity outside of a ball, we prove that the
scattering operator is the identity. Our results give a rigorous proof that the
construction of \cite{glu1, glu2, le}, \cite{pss1} perfectly cloaks passive and
active devices from observation by electromagnetic waves. Furthermore, we prove
cloaking for general anisotropic materials. In particular, our results prove
that it is possible to cloak objects inside general crystals.

Luttinger's sum rule represents an exception. We analyze the conditions under

Numerical examples are given for a simple but non-trivial dynamical two-site

varied, we find small differences in the amplitude and shape dependence of the
reduced 3PCF, at a level qualitatively consistent with recent measurements from
the SDSS and 2dFGRS. We confirm that discrepancies between previous 3PCF
measurements can be explained in part by differences in binning choices. We
explore the degree to which a simple local bias model can fit the simulated

lends further credence to the straightforward association of galaxies with CDM

perturbations from a stellar flyby or stirring by a giant planet modify the
evolution. Although robust comparisons between observations and theory require
better KBO statistics and more comprehensive calculations, the data are broadly
consistent with KBO formation in a massive disk followed by substantial
collisional grinding and dynamical ejection. However, there are important
problems reconciling the results of coagulation and dynamical calculations.
Contrasting our current understanding of the evolution of KBOs and asteroids
suggests that additional observational constraints, such as the identification
of more dynamical families of KBOs (like the 2003 EL61 family), would provide
additional information on the relative roles of collisional grinding and
dynamical ejection in the Kuiper Belt. The uncertainties also motivate
calculations that combine collisional and dynamical evolution, a `unified'
calculation that should give us a better picture of KBO formation and
evolution.

lensing, and optical observations with numerical simulations of the merging
galaxy cluster 1E0657-56. X-ray observations reveal a bullet-like subcluster
with a prominent bow shock, while lensing results show that the positions of
the total mass peaks are consistent with the centroids of the collisionless
galaxies (and inconsistent with the X-ray brightness peaks). Previous studies,
based on older observational datasets, have placed upper limits on the
self-interaction cross-section of dark matter per unit mass, sigma/m, using
simplified analytic techniques. In this work, we take advantage of new,
higher-quality observational datasets by running N-body simulations of
1E0657-56 that include the effects of self-interacting dark matter, and
comparing the results with observations. Furthermore, the recent data allow for
a new independent method of constraining sigma/m, based on the non-observation
of an offset between the bullet subcluster mass peak and galaxy centroid. This
new method places an upper limit (68% confidence) of sigma/m < 1.25 cm^2/g. If
we make the assumption that the subcluster and the main cluster had equal
mass-to-light ratios prior to the merger, we derive our most stringent
constraint of sigma/m < 0.7 cm^2/g, which comes from the consistency of the
subcluster's observed mass-to-light ratio with the main cluster's, and with the
universal cluster value, ruling out the possibility of a large fraction of dark
matter particles being scattered away due to collisions. Our limit is a slight
improvement over the previous result from analytic estimates, and rules out
most of the 0.5 - 5cm^2/g range invoked to explain inconsistencies between the
standard collisionless cold dark matter model and observations.

2155-304 in the infrared-optical band, we explore variability on the scales of
months, days and hours. We made our observations with the robotic 60 cm
telescope REM located at La Silla, Chile. VRIJHK filters were used. PKS
2155-304 was observed from May to December 2005. The wavelength interval
explored, the total number of photometric points and the short integration time
render our photometry substantially superior to previous ones for this source.
On the basis of the intensity and colour we distinguish three different states
of the source, each of duration of months, which include all those described in
the literature. In particular, we report the highest state ever detected in the
H band. The source varied by a factor of 4 in this band, much more than in the
V band (a factor ~2). The source softened with increasing intensity, contrary
to the general pattern observed in the UV-X-ray bands. On five nights of
November we had nearly continuous monitoring for 2-3 hours. A variability
episode with a time scale of ~24 h is well documented, a much more rapid flare
with t=1-2 h, is also apparent, but is supported by relatively few points.

all types of SNe than previously thought. Investigation of the correlations

address the question of classification of ""interacting SNe"" and the possibility
of distinguishing different groups within the diverse IIn subclass.

The spectrum is characterized by a blue continuum on which are superimposed
broad emission lines of HI and HeII and a host of narrower absorption lines of
neutral metals and molecules. Spectral type standard star spectra scaled to the
dereddened spectrum of A0620-00 in K exceed the A0620-00 spectrum in J and H
for all stars of spectral type K7V or earlier, demonstrating that the donor
star, unless later than K7V, cannot be the sole NIR flux source in A0620-00. In
addition, the atomic absorption lines in the K3V spectrum are too weak with
respect to those of A0620-00 even at 100% donor star contribution, restricting
the spectral type of the donor star in A0620-00 to later than K3V. Comparison
of the A0620-00 spectrum to scaled K star spectra indicates that the CO
absorption features are significantly weaker in A0620-00 than in field dwarf
stars. Fits of scaled model spectra of a Roche lobe-filling donor star to the
spectrum of A0620-00 show that the best match to the CO absorption lines is
obtained when the C abundance is reduced to [C/H] = -1.5. The donor star
contribution in the H waveband is determined to be 82+-2%. Combined with
previous published results from Froning & Robinson (2001) and Marsh et al.

monitoring campaign from July 2003 till April 2004. The spectral energy
distribution (SED) was measured over the entire electromagnetic spectrum, with
flux measurements from radio to X-ray frequencies and upper limits in the very
high energy (VHE) gamma-ray regime. Here, we use a time-dependent leptonic jet
model to reproduce the SED and optical spectral variability observed during our
multiwavelength campaign. Our model simulations could successfully reproduce
the observed SED and optical light curves and predict an intrinsic cutoff value
for the VHE gamma-ray emission at ~ 4 GeV. The effect of the optical depth due
to the intergalactic infrared background radiation (IIBR) on the peak of the
high-energy component of 3C 66A was found to be negligible. Also, the presence
of a broad line region (BLR) in the case of 3C 66A may play an important role
in the emission of gamma-ray photons when the emission region is very close to
the central engine, but further out, the production mechanism of hard X-ray and
gamma-ray photons becomes rapidly dominated by synchrotron self-Compton
emission. We further discuss the possibility of an observable X-ray spectral
variability pattern. The simulated results do not predict observable hysteresis
patterns in the optical or soft X-ray regimes for major flares on multi-day

planetary formation mechanisms. Aims: This motivates planet searches around
stars which are significantly more massive or less massive than the Sun, and in
particular our radial velocity search for planets around very-low mass stars.
Methods: As part of that program, we obtained measurements of GJ 674, an M2.5
dwarf at d=4.5 pc, which have a dispersion much in excess of their internal
errors. An intensive observing campaign demonstrates that the excess dispersion
is due to two superimposed coherent signals, with periods of 4.69 and 35 days.
Results: These data are well described by a 2-planet Keplerian model where each
planet has a ~11 Mearth minimum mass. A careful analysis of the (low level)
magnetic activity of GJ 674 however demonstrates that the 35-day period
coincides with the stellar rotation period. This signal therefore originates in
a spot inhomogeneity modulated by stellar rotation. The 4.69-day signal on the
other hand is caused by a bona-fide planet, GJ 674b. Conclusion: Its detection
adds to the growing number of Neptune-mass planets around M-dwarfs, and
reinforces the emerging conclusion that this mass domain is much more populated
than the jovian mass range. We discuss the metallicity distributions of M dwarf
with and without planets and find a low 11% probability that they are drawn
from the same parent distribution. Moreover, we find tentative evidence that
the host star metallicity correlates with the total mass of their planetary
system.

the

the cosmic microwave background, indicating the presence of widespread warm
molecular gas at intermediate densities. Overall, the distributions of H$_2$CO
and CO (taken from the literature) are fairly similar, though significant
differences exist at small scales. Most notably, while the CO peak is nearly
coincident with the S140 H${\alpha}$ arc, the maximum H$_2$CO absorption is
clearly separated from it by a full 10$'$ beam ($\sim$ 3 pc). We argue that
these differences result from differing abundances and excitation requirements.
The CO(1-0) line is more optically thick and more biased towards warm gas than

photodissociated and is, therefore, a poorer tracer of the molecular gas

gluing act on discrete spin structures and how they change the partition
function. These operations allow to reformulate the dimer model as a quantum

envelope of a donor star engulfs a much denser companion, and the core of the
donor plus the dense companion star spiral inward through this dissipative
envelope. As conceived by Paczynski and Ostriker, this process must be
responsible for the creation of short-period binaries with degenerate
components, and, indeed, it has proven capable of accounting for short-period
binaries containing one white dwarf component. However, attempts to reconstruct
the evolutionary histories of close double white dwarfs have proven more
problematic, and point to the need for enhanced systemic mass loss, either
during the close of the first, slow episode of mass transfer that produced the
first white dwarf, or during the detached phase preceding the final, common
envelope episode. The survival of long-period interacting binaries with massive
white dwarfs, such as the recurrent novae T CrB and RS Oph, also presents
interpretative difficulties for simple energetic treatments of common envelope
evolution. Their existence implies that major terms are missing from usual
formulations of the energy budget for common envelope evolution. The most
plausible missing energy term is the energy released by recombination in the
common envelope, and, indeed, a simple reformulation the energy budget
explicitly including recombination resolves this issue.

models range from 5% to 50%. Simulations are performed with the NBODY4 code and
include a full mass spectrum of stars, stellar evolution, binary evolution and
the tidal field of the Galaxy. We find that the overall binary fraction of a
cluster almost always remains close to the primordial value, except at late
times when a cluster is near dissolution. A critical exception occurs in the
central regions where we observe a marked increase in binary fraction with time
-- a simulation starting with 100000 stars and 5% binaries reached a core
binary frequency as high as 40% at the end of the core-collapse phase
(occurring at 16 Gyr with ~20000 stars remaining). Binaries are destroyed in
the core by a variety of processes as a cluster evolves, but the combination of
mass-segregation and creation of new binaries in exchange interactions produces
the observed increase in relative number. We also find that binaries are cycled
into and out of cluster cores in a manner that is analogous to convection in
stars. For models of 100000 stars we show that the evolution of the core-radius
up to the end of the initial phase of core-collapse is not affected by the
exact value of the primordial binary frequency (for frequencies of 10% or
less). We discuss the ramifications of our results for the likely primordial
binary content of globular clusters.

particles as seeds in an iterative search for stable cones. A longstanding
infrared (IR) unsafety issue in such algorithms is often assumed to be solvable
by adding extra `midpoint' seeds, but actually is just postponed to one order
higher in the coupling. A proper solution is to switch to an exact seedless
cone algorithm, one that provably identifies all stable cones. The only
existing approach takes N 2^N time to find jets among N particles, making it
unusable at hadron level. This can be reduced to N^2 ln(N) time, leading to
code (SISCone) whose speed is similar to that of public midpoint
implementations. Monte Carlo tests provide a strong cross-check of an
analytical proof of the IR safety of the new algorithm, and the absence of any
'R_{sep}' issue implies a good practical correspondence between parton and
hadron levels. Relative to a midpoint cone, the use of an IR safe seedless
algorithm leads to modest changes for inclusive jet spectra, mostly through
reduced sensitivity to the underlying event, and significant changes for some
multi-jet observables.

phase in the I=1 channel. The same approach is also applicable to the $K {\bar

constructed that beautifully unifies many types of spinning systems by mapping
them to the same twistor, thus predicting an infinite set of duality relations
among spinning systems with different Hamiltonians. Usual 1T-physics is not
equipped to explain the duality relationships and unification between these
systems. We use 2T-physics in 4+2 dimensions to uncover new properties of
twistors, and expect that our approach will prove to be useful for practical
applications as well as for a deeper understanding of fundamental physics.
Unexpected structures for a new description of spinning particles emerge. A
unifying symmetry SU(2,3) that includes conformal symmetry SU(2,2)=SO(4,2) in
the massless case, turns out to be a fundamental property underlying the
dualities of a large set of spinning systems, including those that occur in
high spin theories. This may lead to new forms of string theory backgrounds as
well as to new methods for studying various corners of M theory. In this paper

(CO) white dwarfs. The dynamical evolution of a 0.9 Msun + 0.6 Msun CO white
dwarf merger is followed by a three-dimensional SPH simulation. We use an
elaborate prescription in which artificial viscosity is essentially absent,
unless a shock is detected, and a much larger number of SPH particles than
earlier calculations. Based on this simulation, we suggest that the central
region of the merger remnant can, once it has reached quasi-static equilibrium,
be approximated as a differentially rotating CO star, which consists of a
slowly rotating cold core and a rapidly rotating hot envelope surrounded by a
centrifugally supported disc. We construct a model of the CO remnant that
mimics the results of the SPH simulation using a one-dimensional hydrodynamic
stellar evolution code and then follow its secular evolution. The stellar
evolution models indicate that the growth of the cold core is controlled by
neutrino cooling at the interface between the core and the hot envelope, and
that carbon ignition in the envelope can be avoided despite high effective
accretion rates. This result suggests that the assumption of forced accretion
of cold matter that was adopted in previous studies of the evolution of double
CO white dwarf merger remnants may not be appropriate. Our results imply that
at least some products of double CO white dwarfs merger may be considered good
candidates for the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae. In this case, the
characteristic time delay between the initial dynamical merger and the eventual
explosion would be ~10^5 yr. (Abridged).

non-linearity of spacetime and we provide a physical interpretation for it. By
mapping this correction to the gravito-electro-magnetic framework, we study the

direction. At the Pierre Auger Observatory in Malargue, Argentina, the phase
function is measured on an hourly basis using two Aerosol Phase Function (APF)
light sources. These sources direct a UV light beam across the field of view of
the fluorescence detectors; the phase function can be extracted from the image
of the shots in the fluorescence detector cameras. This paper describes the
design, current status, standard operation procedure, and performance of the
APF system at the Pierre Auger Observatory.

especially in the study of the evolution of life and cognition. Traditional
studies encounter problems because it is difficult to describe life and
cognition in terms of matter and energy, since their laws are valid only at the
physical scale. However, if matter and energy, as well as life and cognition,
are described in terms of information, evolution can be described consistently
as information becoming more complex.
  The paper presents eight tentative laws of information, valid at multiple
scales, which are generalizations of Darwinian, cybernetic, thermodynamic,
psychological, philosophical, and complexity principles. These are further used
to discuss the notions of life, cognition and their evolution.

their protoplanetary disks, but the extent to which material can flow from the
circumbinary disk across the gap onto the individual circumstellar disks has
been unclear. In binaries with eccentric orbits, periodic perturbation of the
outer disk is predicted to induce mass flow across the gap, resulting in
accretion that varies with the binary period. This accretion may manifest
itself observationally as periodic changes in luminosity. Here we present a
search for such periodic accretion in the pre-main-sequence spectroscopic
binary UZ Tau E. We present BVRI photometry spanning three years; we find that
the brightness of UZ Tau E is clearly periodic, with a best-fit period of 19.16
+/- 0.04 days. This is consistent with the spectroscopic binary period of 19.13
days, refined here from analysis of new and existing radial velocity data. The
brightness of UZ Tau E shows significant random variability, but the overall
periodic pattern is a broad peak in enhanced brightness, spanning more than
half the binary orbital period. The variability of the H-alpha line is not as
clearly periodic, but given the sparseness of the data, some periodic component
is not ruled out. The photometric variations are in good agreement with
predictions from simulations of binaries with orbital parameters similar to
those of UZ Tau E, suggesting that periodic accretion does occur from
circumbinary disks, replenishing the inner disks and possibly extending the
timescale over which they might form planets.

has uncovered their complex multi-mechanism-governed evolution processes.
Therefore, a better understanding of the structure and evolution of these
networked complex systems requires us to describe such processes in a more
detailed and realistic manner. In this paper, we introduce a new type of
network growth rule which comprises addition and deletion of nodes, and propose
an evolving network model to investigate the effect of node deleting on network
structure. It is found that, with the introduction of node deleting, network
structure is significantly transformed. In particular, degree distribution of
the network undergoes a transition from scale-free to exponential forms as the
intensity of node deleting increases. At the same time, nontrivial
disassortative degree correlation develops spontaneously as a natural result of
network evolution in the model. We also demonstrate that node deleting
introduced in the model does not destroy the connectedness of a growing network
so long as the increasing rate of edges is not excessively small. In addition,
it is found that node deleting will weaken but not eliminate the small-world
effect of a growing network, and generally it will decrease the clustering
coefficient in a network.

modeling indicates that a significant fraction of the tip volume is involved in

Catalogue. The observational simplicity of our approach, and the direct
measurements of the black hole predictor quantity, i.e. the Sersic index, for
both elliptical galaxies and the bulges of disc galaxies makes it
straightforward to estimate accurate black hole masses in early- and late-type
galaxies alike. We have parameterised the supermassive black hole mass function
with a Schechter function and find, at the low-mass end, a logarithmic slope
(1+alpha) of ~0.7 for the full galaxy sample and ~1.0 for the early-type galaxy
sample. Considering spheroidal stellar systems brighter than M_B = -18 mag, and
integrating down to black hole masses of 10^6 M_sun, we find that the local
mass density of supermassive black holes in early-type galaxies rho_{bh,
early-type} = (3.5+/-1.2) x 10^5 h^3_{70} M_sun Mpc^{-3}, and in late-type
galaxies rho_{bh, late-type} = (1.0+/-0.5) x 10^5 h^3_{70} M_sun Mpc^{-3}. The
uncertainties are derived from Monte Carlo simulations which include
uncertainties in the M_bh-n relation, the catalogue of Sersic indices, the
galaxy weights and Malmquist bias. The combined, cosmological, supermassive
black hole mass density is thus Omega_{bh, total} = (3.2+/-1.2) x 10^{-6} h_70.
That is, using a new and independent method, we conclude that (0.007+/-0.003)
h^3_{70} per cent of the universe's baryons are presently locked up in
supermassive black holes at the centres of galaxies.

$\pi$N coupling and the pseudovector (PV) representation is obtained via
suitable non-linear field transformations. For both of these cases the effect
of the Dirac sea is estimated. Subsequently, we present results using the

included by re-defining the field parameters as done in the modern effective
field theory approach developed recently. The results are compared with the

SrRuO3 is a ferromagnetic material. Calculated results establish Ti4+ valence
states (similar to SrTiO3), which was predicted experimentally. Thus, Ti
substitution dilutes the Ru-O-Ru connectivity, which is manifested in the
calculated results in the form of significant band narrowing leading to finite
gap between t2g and eg bands. At 75% substitution, a large gap (> 2 eV) appears
at the Fermi level, e_F in the up spin density of states, while the down spin
states contributes at e_F characterizing the system a half-metallic
ferromagnet. The t2g - eg gap can be tailored judiciously by tuning Ti
concentrations to minimize thermal effects, which is often the major bottleneck
to achieve high spin polarization at elevated temperatures in other materials.

in ferromagnetic materials, which are potential candidates for spin-based

operators. Our work consists in a detailed study of the microlocal properties,
which rule the spectral stability or instability phenomena appearing under
small perturbations for elliptic quadratic differential operators. The class of
elliptic quadratic differential operators stands for the class of operators
defined in the Weyl quantization by complex-valued elliptic quadratic symbols.
We establish in this paper a simple necessary and sufficient condition on the
Weyl symbol of these operators, which ensures the stability of their spectra.
When this condition is violated, we prove that it occurs some strong spectral
instabilities for the high energies of these operators, in some regions which
can be far away from their spectra. We give a precise geometrical description
of them, which explains the results obtained for these operators in some
numerical simulations giving the computation of false eigenvalues far from
their spectra by algorithms for eigenvalues computing.

force, at different wave-numbers. This simple mechanical probe makes it
possible to measure excitations of the flow at specific scales, averaged over
space and time: it is a scale-resolved, global measurement. We also measure the
dissipation associated to the string motion, and we consider the ratio of the
fluctuations over dissipation (FDR). In an exploratory approach, we investigate
the concept of {\it effective temperature} defined through the FDR. We compare
our observations with other definitions of temperature in turbulence. From the
theory of Kolmogorov (1941), we derive the exponent -11/3 expected for the

of the recursivity postulate automatically determines the logarithmic
functional form for Shannon entropy. Due to the logarithmic nature, Shannon
entropy naturally gives rise to additivity, when applied to situations having
product probability property. It is argued that the natural process is
non-additivity, important, for example, in statistical mechanics, even in
product probability property situations and additivity can hold due to the
involvement of a recursivity postulate leading to a logarithmic function.
Generalizations, including Mathai's generalized entropy are introduced and some
of the properties are examined. Situations are examined where Mathai's entropy
leads to pathway models, exponential and power law behavior and related

of neutral fractional diffusion, space-fractional diffusion, and

  update to include corrected typos and two additional equations",,,,gr-qc,,"  The effect of introducing a fifth large-scale space-time dimension to the
equations of orbital dynamics was analysed in an earlier paper by the authors.
The results showed good agreement with the observed flat rotation curves of
galaxies and the Pioneer Anomaly. This analysis did not require the
modification of Newtonian dynamics, but rather only their restatement in a five
dimensional framework. The same analysis derived a acceleration parameter ar,
which plays an important role in the restated equations of orbital dynamics,
and suggested a value for ar. In this companion paper, the principle of
conservation of energy is restated within the same five-dimensional framework.
The resulting analysis provides an alternative route to estimating the value of
ar, without reference to the equations of orbital dynamics, and based solely on
key cosmological constants and parameters, including the gravitational
constant, G. The same analysis suggests that: (i) the inverse square law of
gravity may itself be due to the conservation of energy at the boundary between
a four-dimensional universe and a fifth large-scale space-time dimension; and
(ii) there is a limiting case for the Tulley-Fisher relationship linking the
speed of light to the mass of the Universe.

to the lattice Boltzmann (LB) methods, basic aspects of the theory still remain
unchallenged. An unsolved theoretical issue is related to the construction of a
discrete kinetic theory which yields \textit{exactly} the fluid equations,
i.e., is non-asymptotic (here denoted as \textit{LB inverse kinetic theory}).
The purpose of this paper is theoretical and aims at developing an inverse
kinetic approach of this type. In principle infinite solutions exist to this
problem but the freedom can be exploited in order to meet important
requirements. In particular, the discrete kinetic theory can be defined so that
it yields exactly the fluid equation also for arbitrary non-equilibrium (but
suitably smooth) kinetic distribution functions and arbitrarily close to the
boundary of the fluid domain. Unlike previous entropic LB methods the theorem
can be obtained without functional constraints on the class of the initial
distribution functions. Possible realizations of the theory and asymptotic
approximations are provided which permit to determine the fluid equations
\textit{with prescribed accuracy.} As a result, asymptotic accuracy estimates
of customary LB approaches and comparisons with the Chorin artificial
compressibility method are discussed.

downward transitions. Numerical calculations for the transition rates are
performed for a deep silica-induced potential allowing for a large number of

is shown to be determined mainly by the bound-to-bound transitions for deep
bound levels and by bound-to-free transitions for shallow bound levels.
Moreover, the phonon emission and absorption processes can be orders of
magnitude larger for deep bound levels as compared to the shallow bound ones.
We also study various types of transitions from free states. We show that, for
thermal atomic cesium with temperature in the range from 100 $\mu$K to 400

emission. Among these, the Carina nebula possesses the brightest soft diffuse
emission. The required plasma temperature and thermal energy can be produced by
collisions or termination of fast winds from main-sequence or embedded young O
stars, but the extended emission is often observed from regions apart from
massive stellar clusters. The origin of the X-ray emission is unknown.
  The XIS CCD camera onboard Suzaku has the best spectral resolution for
extended soft sources so far, and is therefore capable of measuring key
emission lines in the soft band. Suzaku observed the core and the eastern side
of the Carina nebula (Car-D1) in 2005 Aug and 2006 June, respectively. Spectra
of the south part of the core and Car-D1 similarly showed strong L-shell lines
of iron ions and K-shell lines of silicon ions, while in the north of the core
these lines were much weaker. Fitting the spectra with an absorbed thin-thermal
plasma model showed kT~0.2, 0.6 keV and NH~1-2e21 cm-2 with a factor of 2-3
abundance variation in oxygen, magnesium, silicon and iron. The plasma might
originate from an old supernova, or a super shell of multiple supernovae.

it as minus the Hessian matrix of the volume of the polar dual. As a corollary,
$\mu(G) \ge d$ if $G$ is the 1-skeleton of a convex $d$-polytope.
  Determination of the signature of the Hessian of the volume is based on the

and 24 to the L4 one. These data together with those already published by
Fornasier et al. (2004a) and Dotto et al. (2006), constitute a total sample of
visible spectra for 80 objects. The survey allows us to investigate six
families (Aneas, Anchises, Misenus, Phereclos, Sarpedon, Panthoos) in the L5
cloud and four L4 families (Eurybates, Menelaus, 1986 WD and 1986 TS6). The
sample that we measured is dominated by D--type asteroids, with the exception
of the Eurybates family in the L4 swarm, where there is a dominance of C- and
P-type asteroids. All the spectra that we obtained are featureless with the
exception of some Eurybates members, where a drop--off of the reflectance is
detected shortward of 5200 A. Similar features are seen in main belt C-type
asteroids and commonly attributed to the intervalence charge transfer
transition in oxidized iron. Our sample comprises fainter and smaller Trojans
as compared to the literature's data and allows us to investigate the
properties of objects with estimated diameter smaller than 40--50 km. The
analysis of the spectral slopes and colors versus the estimated diameters shows
that the blue and red objects have indistinguishable size distribution. We
perform a statistical investigation of the Trojans's spectra property
distributions as a function of their orbital and physical parameters, and in
comparison with other classes of minor bodies in the outer Solar System.
Trojans at lower inclination appear significantly bluer than those at higher
inclination, but this effect is strongly driven by the Eurybates family.

sample was selected to investigate whether objects of this kind could be relics
of radio-loud AGNs switched off at very early stages of their evolution or
possibly to indicate intermittent activity. Initial observations were made
using MERLIN at 5 GHz. The sources have now been observed with the VLBA at 1.7,
5 and 8.4 GHz in a snapshot mode with phase-referencing. The resulting maps are
presented along with unpublished 8.4-GHz VLA images of five sources. Some of
the sources discussed here show a complex radio morphology and therefore a
complicated past that, in some cases, might indicate intermittent activity. One
of the sources studied - 1045+352 - is known as a powerful radio and
infrared-luminous broad absorption line (BAL) quasar. It is a young CSS object
whose asymmetric two-sided morphology on a scale of several hundred parsecs,
extending in two different directions, may suggest intermittent activity. The
young age and compact structure of 1045+352 is consistent with the evolution
scenario of BAL quasars. It has also been confirmed that the submillimetre flux
of 1045+352 can be seriously contaminated by synchrotron emission.

both scalar and vector potentials are spherical, these conditions for
isospectrality imply that the spin-orbit and Darwin terms of either the upper

equivalent, as far as energy is concerned, to a spin-0 state. In this case,
besides energy, a scalar particle will also have the same orbital angular

the strength of scalar field potential, there exist two phases of quantum
gravity with scalar field: one with essentially anisotropic behavior of field
correlation functions near the cosmological singularity, and another with
quasi-isotropic behavior. The ``phase transition'' between the two phases is
interpreted as the condensation of gravitons.

(2001) has been intensively discussed by various authors. In analyses
undertaken to date, trigonometric parallaxes are crucial missing data. Distance
measurements are mandatory to kinematically segregate halo object from disk
objects and hence enable a more reliable estimate of the local density of halo
dark matter residing in such objects.
  We present trigonometric parallax measurements for 15 candidate halo white
dwarfs (WDs) selected from the Oppenheimer et al. (2001) list. We observed the
stars using the ESO 1.56-m Danish Telescope and ESO 2.2-m telescope from August
2001 to July 2004. Parallaxes with accuracies of 1--2 mas were determined
yielding relative errors on distances of $\sim5$% for 6 objects, $\sim12$% for
3 objects, and $\sim20$% for two more objects. Four stars appear to be too
distant (probably farther than 100 pc) to have measurable parallaxes in our
observations. Distances, absolute magnitudes and revised space velocities were
derived for the 15 halo WDs from the Oppenheimer et al. (2001) list. Halo
membership is confirmed unambiguously for 6 objects while 5 objects may be
thick disk members and 4 objects are too distant to draw any conclusion based
solely on kinematics. Comparing our trigonometric parallaxes with photometric
parallaxes used in previous work reveals an overestimation of distance as
derived from photometric techniques. This new data set can be used to revise
the halo white dwarf space density, and that analysis will be presented in a
subsequent publication.

high degree of differential rotation are dynamically unstable against bar-mode
deformation, even for values of the ratio of rotational kinetic energy to
gravitational potential energy as low as O(0.01). This may have implications
for gravitational wave astronomy in high-frequency sources such as core
collapse supernovae. In this paper we present high-resolution simulations,
performed with an adaptive mesh refinement hydrodynamics code, of such low
T/|W| bar-mode instability. The complex morphological features involved in the
nonlinear dynamics of the instability are revealed in our simulations, which
show that the excitation of Kelvin-Helmholtz-like fluid modes outside the
corotation radius of the star leads to the saturation of the bar-mode
deformation. While the overall trends reported in an earlier investigation are
confirmed by our work, we also find that numerical resolution plays an
important role during the long-term, nonlinear behaviour of the instability,
which has implications on the dynamics of rotating stars and on the attainable
amplitudes of the associated gravitational wave signals.

networks of interaction, such as model social networks, have been shown to have
a fundamental effect on the dynamics and outcome of evolutionary games. These
effects have, however, proved to be sensitive to the details of the underlying
topology and dynamics. Here we introduce a minimal population structure that is
described by two distinct hierarchical levels of interaction. We believe this
model is able to identify effects of spatial structure that do not depend on
the details of the topology. We derive the dynamics governing the evolution of
a system starting from fundamental individual level stochastic processes
through two successive meanfield approximations. In our model of population
structure the topology of interactions is described by only two parameters: the
effective population size at the local scale and the relative strength of local
dynamics to global mixing. We demonstrate, for example, the existence of a
continuous transition leading to the dominance of cooperation in populations
with hierarchical levels of unstructured mixing as the benefit to cost ratio
becomes smaller then the local population size. Applying our model of spatial
structure to the repeated prisoner's dilemma we uncover a novel and
counterintuitive mechanism by which the constant influx of defectors sustains
cooperation. Further exploring the phase space of the repeated prisoner's
dilemma and also of the ""rock-paper-scissor"" game we find indications of rich
structure and are able to reproduce several effects observed in other models
with explicit spatial embedding, such as the maintenance of biodiversity and
the emergence of global oscillations.

and wave profiles of torsional Alfven oscillations in solar coronal loops.
Dispersion relations for torsional oscillations are derived analytically in
limits of weak and strong inhomogeneities. These analytical results are
verified by numerical solutions, which are valid for a wide range of
inhomogeneity strength. It is shown that the inhomogeneous mass density field
leads to the reduction of a wave frequency of torsional oscillations, in
comparison to that of estimated from mass density at the loop apex. This
frequency reduction results from the decrease of an average Alfven speed as far
as the inhomogeneous loop is denser at its footpoints. The derived dispersion
relations and wave profiles are important for potential observations of
torsional oscillations which result in periodic variations of spectral line
widths. Torsional oscillations offer an additional powerful tool for a
development of coronal seismology.

only be identified by means of an exhaustive search, whilst convergence towards
low bit error probabilities can be problematic when the systematic output of a
rate-1/2 partially systematic PCCC is heavily punctured. In this paper, we
present and study a family of rate-1/2 partially systematic PCCCs, which we
call pseudo-randomly punctured codes. We evaluate their bit error rate
performance and we show that they always yield a lower error floor than that of
their rate-1/3 parent codes. Furthermore, we compare analytic results to
simulations and we demonstrate that their performance converges towards the
error floor region, owning to the moderate puncturing of their systematic
output. Consequently, we propose pseudo-random puncturing as a means of
improving the bandwidth efficiency of a PCCC and simultaneously lowering its
error floor.

that eventhough coordinate distance shrinks to zero, physical distance does
not. So, there is some remaining space which geometry has been computed and
identified as a generalized Nariai solution. The thermal properties of this new

stacking axis as a function of temperature. Above the metal-insulator
transition related to the anion ordering the optical conductivity spectra show
a Drude-like response. Below the transition an energy gap of about 1500 cm-1
(185 meV) opens, leading to the corresponding charge transfer band in the
optical conductivity spectra. The analysis of the infrared-active vibrations
gives evidence for the long-range crystal structure modulation below the
transition temperature and for the short-range order fluctuations of the
lattice modulation above the transition temperature. Also we report about a new
infrared mode at around 710 cm-1 with a peculiar temperature behavior, which
has so far not been observed in any other (TMTSF)2X salt showing a
metal-insulator transition. A qualitative model based on the coupling between
the TMTSF molecule vibration and the reorientation of electrical dipole moment
of the FSO3 anion is proposed, in order to explain the anomalous behavior of
the new mode.

expectation values in various bound states and show that the expectation value
really turns out to be zero, a consequence of the fact that the momentum
expectation value is real. We comment briefly on the status of the angular

the spectral type of the companion to be M3+-0.5V. The derived spectral type as
well as the near infrared photometry of the companion are both fully consistent
with a 0.26+-0.07 Msol dwarf located at the distance of HD141272 (21 pc).
Furthermore the photometry data rules out the pre-main sequence status, since
the system is consistent with the ZAMS of the Pleiades.

of a model with one sterile neutrino separated from three active ones by an
$\mathcal{O}(\eVq)$ mass-squared difference, $\Dmq_\Sbl$. We perform our
analysis using the OPERA detector as a reference (our analysis can be upgraded
including a detailed simulation of the ICARUS detector). We point out that the
channel with the largest potential to constrain the sterile neutrino parameter
space at the CNGS beam is $\nu_\mu \to \nu_\tau$. The reason for that is
twofold: first, the active-sterile mixing angle that governs this oscillation
is the less constrained by present experiments; second, this is the signal for
which both OPERA and ICARUS have been designed, and thus benefits from an
extremely low background. In our analysis we also took into account $\nu_\mu
\to \nu_e$ oscillations. We find that the CNGS potential to look for sterile
neutrinos is limited with nominal intensity of the beam, but it is
significantly enhanced with a factor 2 to 10 increase in the neutrino flux.
Data from both channels allow us, in this case, to constrain further the
four-neutrino model parameter space. Our results hold for any value of
$\Dmq_\Sbl \gtrsim 0.1 \eVq$, \textit{i.e.} when oscillations driven by this
mass-squared difference are averaged. We have also checked that the bound on
$\theta_{13}$ that can be put at the CNGS is not affected by the possible
existence of sterile neutrinos.

around a body with an axisymmetric mass quadrupole moment Q to linear order in
Q, to the leading post-Newtonian order, and to linear order in the mass ratio.
This system admits three constants of the motion in absence of radiation
reaction: energy, angular momentum, and a third constant analogous to the
Carter constant. We compute instantaneous and time-averaged rates of change of
these three constants. For a point particle orbiting a black hole, Ryan has
computed the leading order evolution of the orbit's Carter constant, which is
linear in the spin. Our result, when combined with an interaction quadratic in
the spin (the coupling of the black hole's spin to its own radiation reaction
field), gives the next to leading order evolution. The effect of the
quadrupole, like that of the linear spin term, is to circularize eccentric
orbits and to drive the orbital plane towards antialignment with the symmetry
axis. In addition we consider a system of two point masses where one body has a
single mass multipole or current multipole. To linear order in the mass ratio,
to linear order in the multipole, and to the leading post-Newtonian order, we
show that there does not exist an analog of the Carter constant for such a
system (except for the cases of spin and mass quadrupole). With mild additional
assumptions, this result falsifies the conjecture that all vacuum, axisymmetric
spacetimes posess a third constant of geodesic motion.

connections on the structural properties of the cortical networks. The brain
networks' structural decay is in most respects similar to that of scale-free

connections as structural basis for some of the conditional robustness of brain
systems. This informs the understanding of the development of brain networks'
connectivity.

because of their role as heavy traffic approximations for some stochastic

satisfies the definition of an SRBM, except for small random perturbations in
the defining conditions, to be close in distribution to an SRBM. A crucial
ingredient in the proof of this result is an oscillation inequality for
solutions of a perturbed Skorokhod problem. We use the invariance principle to
show weak existence of SRBMs under mild conditions. We also use the invariance
principle, in conjunction with known uniqueness results for SRBMs, to give some
sufficient conditions for validating approximations involving (i) SRBMs in

form a bulk of hot, dense nuclear matter with a sufficiently large volume and
long duration, due to the largely deformed uranium nuclei. The nucleon sideward
flow in the tip-tip collisions is nearly 3 times larger than that in body-body
ones at normalized impact parameter $b/b_{max}<0.5$, and that the body-body
central collisions have a largest negative nucleon elliptic flow $v_{2}=-12%$

novel experimental observables in tip-tip and body-body collisions can provide
a good condition and sensitive probe to study the nuclear EoS, respectively.

and the Klein-Gordon equation for spin-0 particles - one could try to use
non-local field equations in order to describe scattering processes. The latter
equations can be obtained by means of the relativistic energy together with the
correspondence principle, resulting in equations with a square root operator.
By coupling them to an electromagnetic field and expanding the square root (and
taking into account terms of quadratic order in the electromagnetic coupling
constant e), it is possible to calculate scattering matrix elements within the
framework of quantum electrodynamics, e.g. like those for Compton scattering or
for the scattering of two identical particles. This will be done here for the

impact of this flux on the formation of molecular hydrogen and cooling in the
first galaxies, assuming different types of radiation sources (e.g. Pop II and
Pop III stars, miniquasars). We find that H- photodissociation reduces the
formation of H2 molecules by a factor of ~1+1000k_s*x/(f_esc*delta), where x is
the mean ionized fraction in the IGM, f_esc is the fraction of ionizing photons
that escape from their progenitor halos, delta is the local gas overdensity and
k_s is an order unity constant which depends on the type of radiation source.
By the time a significant fraction of the universe becomes ionized, H-
photodissociation may significantly reduce the H2 abundance and, with it, the
primordial star formation rate, delaying the progress of reionization.

status for the near-infrared source CB54YC1-II. The mid-infrared luminosity for
CB54YC1-II was found to be $L_{midir} \approx 8 L_\sun$, and we estimate a
central source mass of $M_* \approx 0.8 M_\sun$ (for a mass accretion rate of
${\dot M}=10^{-6} M_\sun yr^{-1}$). CB54 harbors another near-infrared source
(CB54YC1-I), which was not detected by our observations. The non-detection is
consistent with CB54YC1-I being a highly extinguished embedded young A or B
star or a background G or F giant. An alternative explanation for CB54YC1-I is
that the source is an embedded protostar viewed at an extremely high
inclination angle, and the near-infrared detections are not of the central
protostar, but of light scattered by the accretion disk into our line of sight.
In addition, we have discovered three new mid-infrared sources, which are
spatially coincident with the previously known dense core in CB54. The source
temperatures ($\sim100$K) and association of the mid-infrared sources with the
dense core suggests that these mid-infrared objects may be embedded class 0
protostars.

be viewed as a first application of the coordinatizations, and serve to make

treatment of different types of boundary problems in an unified way. In
particular we obtain a smooth transition to the infinitesimal version by using
a current with a one point support.

conclusions change when the Killing generator becomes null, such as at Killing
horizons.) Next we demonstrate that the same Weyl types characterize warped
product spacetimes with a one-dimensional Lorentzian (timelike) factor, whereas
warped spacetimes with a two-dimensional Lorentzian factor are restricted to
the types D or O. By exploring the Bianchi identities, we then analyze the
simplest non-trivial case from the above classes - type D vacuum spacetimes,
possibly with a cosmological constant, dropping, however, the assumptions that
the spacetime is static, stationary or warped. It is shown that for ``generic''
type D vacuum spacetimes the corresponding principal null directions are
geodetic in any dimension (this applies also to type II spacetimes). For n>=5,
however, there may exist particular cases of type D spacetimes which admit
non-geodetic multiple principal null directions and we present such examples in
any n>=7. Further studies are restricted to five dimensions, where the type D
Weyl tensor is described by a 3x3 matrix \Phi_{ij}. In the case with
``twistfree'' (A_{ij}=0) principal null geodesics we show that in a ``generic''
case \Phi_{ij} is symmetric and eigenvectors of \Phi_{ij} coincide with those
of the expansion matrix S_{ij}, providing us with three preferred spacelike
directions of the spacetime. Similar results are also obtained when relaxing
the twistfree condition and assuming instead that \Phi_{ij} is symmetric. The
n=5 Myers-Perry black hole and Kerr-NUT-AdS metrics in arbitrary dimension are
briefly studied as specific examples of type D vacuum spacetime.

up new decay channels for the Higgs boson to decay into lighter right-handed
neutrinos. These channels may dominate over all other channels if the Higgs
boson is light. For a Higgs boson mass larger than $2 m_W$ the new decays are
subdominant yet still of interest. The right-handed neutrinos have macroscopic
decay lengths and decay mostly into final states containing leptons and quarks.
A distinguishing collider signature of this scenario is a pair of displaced
vertices violating lepton number. A general operator analysis is performed
using the minimal flavor violation hypothesis to illustrate that these novel
decay processes can occur while remaining consistent with experimental
constraints on lepton number violating processes. In this context the question
of whether these new decay modes dominate is found to depend crucially on the
approximate flavor symmetries of the right-handed neutrinos.

70573. The star is a G type dwarf located at a distance of 46 pc with age
estimation between 20 and 300 Myrs. We carried out spectroscopic observations
of this star with FEROS at the 2.2 m MPG/ESO telescope at La Silla. Our
spectroscopic analysis yields a spectral type of G1-1.5V and an age of about
100 Myrs. Variations in stellar radial velocity of HD 70573 have been monitored
since December 2003 until January 2007. The velocity accuracy of FEROS within
this period is about 10 m/s. HD 70573 shows a radial velocity variation with a
period of 852 +/- 12 days and a semi-amplitude of 149 +/- 6 m/s. The period of
this variation is significantly longer than its rotational period, which is 3.3
days. Based on the analysis of the Ca II K emission line, Halpha and Teff
variation as stellar activity indicators as well as the lack of a correlation
between the bisector velocity span and the radial velocity, we can exclude the
rotational modulation and non-radial pulsations as the source of the
long-period radial velocity variation. Thus, the presence of a low-mass
companion around the star provides the best explanation for the observed radial
velocity variation. Assuming a primary mass m1=1.0 +/- 0.1 Msun for the host
star, we calculated a minimum mass of the companion m2sini of 6.1 Mjup, which
lies in the planetary mass regime, and an orbital semi-major axis of 1.76 AU.
The orbit of the planet has an eccentricity of e=0.4. The planet discovery
around the young star HD 70573 gives an important input for the study of debris
disks around young stars and their relation to the presence of planets.

deform the compactification manifold itself in a way which naturally
compliments many features of unified model building. We realize this idea
explicitly by deforming a manifold engineered to give rise to an $SU_5$ grand
unified model into a one giving rise to the Standard Model. In this framework,
the relative local positions of the singularities giving rise to Standard Model
fields are specified in terms of the values of a small number of complex
structure moduli which deform the original manifold, greatly reducing the
arbitrariness of their relative positions.

we described how to use the tools of geometrical engineering to deform
geometrically-engineered grand unified models into ones with lower symmetry.
This top-down unfolding has the advantage that the relative positions of
singularities giving rise to the many `low energy' matter fields are related by
only a few parameters which deform the geometry of the unified model. And
because the relative positions of singularities are necessary to compute the
superpotential, for example, this is a framework in which the arbitrariness of
geometrically engineered models can be greatly reduced.
  In our earlier paper, this picture was made concrete for the case of
deforming the representations of an SU(5) model into their Standard Model
content. In this paper we continue that discussion to show how a geometrically
engineered 16 of SO(10) can be unfolded into the Standard Model, and how the
three families of the Standard Model uniquely emerge from the unfolding of a
single, isolated E8 singularity.

`hot Jupiters' in situ, they are generally assumed to have migrated to their
present orbits through interactions with their nascent discs. In this paper, we
present a systematic study of giant planet migration in power law discs. We
find that the planetary migration rate is proportional to the disc surface
density. This is inconsistent with the assumption that the migration rate is
simply the viscous drift speed of the disc. However, this result can be
obtained by balancing the angular momentum of the planet with the viscous
torque in the disc. We have verified that this result is not affected by
adjusting the resolution of the grid, the smoothing length used, or the time at
which the planet is released to migrate.

self-mirror even at the quantum level. Using the self-mirror property, we
derive the complete prepotential on X, going beyond the results of Part A. In

Transmission Grating Spectrometer (HETGS) on board the {\em Chandra X-ray
Observatory}. Numerous absorption lines were detected in the HETGS spectrum.
The lines are associated with highly ionized Ne, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, and Fe,
some of which have been seen in earlier HETGS observations. Surprisingly,
however, we discovered dramatic variability of the lines over the duration of
the present observation. For instance, the flux of the Ne X line at 12.14 \AA\
was about $5 \times 10^{-3}$ photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in the early part of
the observation but became subsequently undetectable, with a 99% upper limit of
$0.06 \times 10^{-3}$ photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ on the flux of the line. This
implies that the line weakened by nearly two orders of magnitude on a timescale
of hours. The overall X-ray flux of the source did also vary during the
observation but only by 20--30%. For Cyg X-1, the absorption lines are
generally attributed to the absorption of X-rays by ionized stellar wind in the

orbital separations ranging from 0.5AU to infinity. This includes analogs to
all the Solar System's planets except for Mercury, as well as most types of
planets predicted by planet formation theories. Such a survey will provide
results on the frequency of planets around all types of stars except those with
short lifetimes. Close-in planets with separations < 0.5 AU are invisible to a
space-based microlensing survey, but these can be found by Kepler. Other
methods, including ground-based microlensing, cannot approach the comprehensive
statistics on the mass and semi-major axis distribution of extrasolar planets
that a space-based microlensing survey will provide. The terrestrial planet
sensitivity of a ground-based microlensing survey is limited to the vicinity of
the Einstein radius at 2-3 AU, and space-based imaging is needed to identify
and determine the mass of the planetary host stars for the vast majority of
planets discovered by microlensing. Thus, a space-based microlensing survey is
likely to be the only way to gain a comprehensive understanding of the nature
of planetary systems, which is needed to understand planet formation and
habitability. The proposed Microlensing Planet Finder (MPF) mission is an
example of a space-based microlensing survey that can accomplish these
objectives with proven technology and a cost that fits comfortably under the

that both components are young, comoving members of the association; we also
present high-resolution observations which show that the primary is itself a
close binary system. If the Aab and B components are gravitationally bound, the
system would fall into the small class of young multiple systems which have
unusually wide separations as compared to field systems of similar mass.
However, we demonstrate that physical association can not be assumed purely on
probabilistic grounds for any individual candidate system in this separation
range. Analysis of the association's two-point correlation function shows that
there is a significant probability (25%) that at least one pair of low-mass

use these data in combination with published data to probe the large-scale

these RMs oscillate with longitude in a manner that correlates with the
locations of the Galactic spiral arms. The observed pattern in RMs requries the
presence of at least one large-scale magnetic reversal in the fourth Galactic
quadrant, located between the Sagittarius- Carina and Scutum-Crux spiral arms.
To quantitatively compare our measurements to other recent studies, we consider
all available extragalactic and pulsar RMs in the region we have surveyed, and
jointly fit these data to simple models in which the large-scale field follows
the spiral arms. In the best-fitting model, the magnetic field in the fourth
Galactic quadrant is directed clockwise in the Sagittarius-Carina spiral arm
(as viewed from the North Galactic pole), but is oriented counter- clockwise in
the Scutum-Crux arm. This contrasts with recent analyses of pulsar RMs alone,
in which the fourth-quadrant field was presumed to be directed
counter-clockwise in the Sagittarius- Carina arm. Also in contrast to recent
pulsar RM studies, our joint modeling of pulsar and extragalactic RMs
demonstrates that large numbers of large-scale magnetic field reversals are not
required to account for observations.

then there are compensating changes of entanglement that involve the control.
When the entanglement increases, the map that describes the change of the state

around the pre-main sequence M1 dwarf TWA 7 using the SCUBA camera on the James
Clerk Maxwell Telescope. These data confirm the presence of a cold dust disk
around TWA 7, a member of the TW Hydrae Association. Based on the 850 micron
flux, we estimate the mass of the disk to be 18 lunar masses (0.2 Earth masses)
assuming a mass opacity of 1.7 cm^2/g with a temperature of 45 K. This makes
the TWA 7 disk (d=55 pc) an order of magnitude more massive than the disk
reported around AU Microscopii (GL 803), the closest (9.9 pc) debris disk
detected around an M dwarf. This is consistent with TWA 7 being slightly
younger than AU Mic. We find that the mid-IR and submillimeter data require the
disk to be comprised of dust at a range of temperatures. A model in which the
dust is at a single radius from the star, with a range of temperatures
according to grain size, is as effective at fitting the emission spectrum as a
model in which the dust is of uniform size, but has a range of temperatures
according to distance. We discuss this disk in the context of known disks in
the TW Hydrae Association and around low-mass stars; a comparison of masses of
disks in the TWA reveals no trend in mass or evolutionary state (gas-rich vs.
debris) as a function of spectral type.

demonstrate the method on the 50-atom dileucine peptide, showing that
equilibrium distributions are attained for manageable cooling schedules. For
this system, as naively implemented here, the method is modestly more efficient
than constant temperature simulation. However, the method is worth considering
whenever any simulated heating or cooling is performed (as is often done at the
beginning of a simulation project, or during an NMR structure calculation), as
it is simple to implement and requires minimal additional CPU expense.
Furthermore, the naive implementation presented here can be improved.

properties of the black hole and the surrounding accretion disk in an X-ray
binary based on modeling the disk X-ray continuum of the source. We base our
work mainly on two XMM-Newton observations of GX 339-4, because they provided
high-quality data at low energies (below 1 keV) which are critical for reliably
modeling the spectrum of the accretion disk. A key issue examined is the
determination of the so-called ""color correction factor"", which is often
empirically introduced to account for the deviation of the local disk spectrum
from a blackbody (due to electron scattering). This factor cannot be
pre-determined theoretically because it may vary with, e.g., mass accretion
rate, among a number of important factors. We follow up on an earlier
suggestion to estimate the color correction observationally by modeling the
disk spectrum with saturated Compton scattering. We show that the spectra can
be fitted well and the approach yields reasonable values for the color
correction factor. For comparison, we have also attempted to fit the spectra
with other models. We show that even the high-soft-state continuum (which is
dominated by the disk emission) cannot be satisfactorily fitted by
state-of-the-art disk models. We discuss the implication of the results.

various applications in bioinformatics, machine learning and databases and its
(in)approximability remains open. In this paper, we show that for a wide range

consistent results assuming the sequential decay effect in dynamical model to
be small. A comparison with several other independent studies is also made to
obtain important constraint on the form of the density dependence of the
symmetry energy. The comparison rules out an extremely "" stiff "" and "" soft ""
form of the density dependence of the symmetry energy with important
implications for astrophysical and nuclear physics studies.

system which evolves through an arbitrarily long succession of metastable

competitively from a single initial phase. For such a system, we present a
general method to extract from numerical simulations the individual nucleation
rates of the nucleating phases. The results show that the Ostwald rule, which
predicts which phase will nucleate, must be modified probabilistically when the
new phases are almost equally stable. Finally, we show that the nucleation rate
of a phase depends, among other things, on the number of other phases
accessible from it.

that the ratio of box size $L_{\parallel}$ to crossover radius $r_{\rm

emission component. The Suzaku observation confirms the presence of the soft
excess emission, but it does not confirm the presence of redshifted OVII lines
in the cluster. Radial profiles and 2D maps derived from XMM-Newton
observations show that the soft excess emission has a strong peak at the
position of the central cD galaxy and the maps do not show any significant
azimuthal variations. Although the soft excess emission can be fitted equally
well with both thermal and non-thermal models, its spatial distribution is
neither consistent with the models of intercluster warm-hot filaments, nor with
models of clumpy warm intracluster gas associated with infalling groups. Using
the data obtained by the XMM-Newton Reflection Grating Spectrometers we do not
confirm the presence of the warm gas in the cluster centre with the expected
properties assuming the soft excess is of thermal origin. The observed
properties of the soft excess emission are consistent with the non-thermal
interpretation. While the high density of relativistic electrons associated
with the peak of the soft emission in the cluster centre might have been
provided by an active galactic nucleus in the central cD galaxy, the underlying
population might have been accelerated in diffuse shocks.

formation, to a low-mass dominated mode, in numerical simulations, at a
metallicity of 10^-3 Zsolar. We incorporate a new method for including the
radiative cooling from metals into adaptive mesh-refinement hydrodynamic
simulations. Our results illustrate how metals, produced by the first stars,
led to a transition from the high-mass star formation mode of Pop III stars, to
the low-mass mode that dominates today. We ran hydrodynamic simulations with
cosmological initial conditions in the standard LambdaCDM model, with
metallicities, from zero to 10^-2 Zsolar, beginnning at redshift, z = 99. The
simulations were run until a dense core forms at the center of a 5 x 10^5
Msolar dark matter halo, at z ~ 18. Analysis of the central 1 Msolar core
reveals that the two simulations with the lowest metallicities, Z = 0 and 10^-4
Zsolar, contain one clump with 99% of the mass, while the two with
metallicities, Z = 10^-3 and 10^-2 Zsolar, each contain two clumps that share
most of the mass. The Z = 10^-3 Zsolar simulation also produced two low-mass
proto-stellar objects with masses between 10^-2 and 10^-1 Msolar. Gas with Z >=
10^-3 Zsolar is able to cool to the temperature of the CMB, which sets a lower
limit to the minimum fragmentation mass. This suggests that the second
generation stars produced a spectrum of lower mass stars, but were still more
massive on average than stars formed in the local universe.

which is many times longer than the crossing times implied by their velocity
dispersions and radii. We therefore apply the Virial Theorem to derive the
kinematic mass for 15 of the SSCs. The SSCs have masses of 2 x 10^5 to 4 x 10^6
solar masses, with a total population mass of 1.4 x 10^7 solar masses.
Comparison of the loci of the young M82 SSCs and old Milky Way globular
clusters in a plot of radius versus velocity dispersion suggests that the SSCs
are a population of potential globular clusters. We present the mass function
for the SSCs, and find a power law fit with an index of gamma = -1.91 +/- 0.06.
This result is nearly identical to the mass function of young SSCs in the
Antennae galaxies.

color distribution of stars in the horizontal-branch (HB) phase. This
phenomenon is now best understood as due to the presence of helium enhanced
second generation subpopulations, which has raised a possibility that these
peculiar GCs might have a unique origin. Here we show that these GCs with
extended HB are clearly distinct from other normal GCs in kinematics and mass.
The GCs with extended HB are more massive than normal GCs, and are dominated by
random motion with no correlation between kinematics and metallicity.
Surprisingly, however, when they are excluded, most normal GCs in the inner
halo show clear signs of dissipational collapse that apparently led to the
formation of the disk. Normal GCs in the outer halo share their kinematic
properties with the extended HB GCs, which is consistent with the accretion
origin. Our result further suggests heterogeneous origins of GCs, and we
anticipate this to be a starting point for more detailed investigations of
Milky Way formation, including early mergers, collapse, and later accretion.

two-dimensional bending energy is assumed in the Hamiltonian. The skeletons are
composed of elastic linear-chains and rigid junctions and form a
compartmentalized structure on the surface, and for this reason the vertices of
triangles can diffuse freely only inside the compartments. As a consequence, an
inhomogeneous structure is introduced in the model; the surface strength inside
the compartments is different from the surface strength on the compartments.
However, the rotational symmetry is not influenced by the elastic skeletons;
there is no specific direction on the surface. In addition to the three phases
mentioned above, a collapsed phase is expected to exist in the low bending
rigidity regime that was not studied here. The inhomogeneous structure and the
fluidity of vertices are considered to be the origin of such variety of phases.

percolative superconductor is considered. The superconductor contains
percolative superconducting cluster carrying a transport current and clusters
of a normal phase, acting as pinning centers. A prototype of such a structure
is YBCO film, containing clusters of columnar defects, as well as the BSCCO/Ag
sheathed tape, which is of practical interest for wire fabrication. Transition
of the superconductor into a resistive state corresponds to the percolation
transition from a pinned vortex state to a resistive state when the vortices
are free to move. The dependencies of the free vortex density on the fractal
dimension of the cluster boundary as well as the resistance on the transport
current are obtained. It is revealed that a mixed state of the vortex glass
type is realized in the superconducting system involved. The current-voltage
characteristics of superconductors containing fractal clusters are obtained and
their features are studied.

heavy nuclei, like the charge and the shape, are studied in the Time-Dependent
Hartree-Fock theory. The pre-equilibrium Giant Dipole Resonance (GDR) is used
to probe the fusion path. It is shown that such isovector collective state is
excited in N/Z asymmetric fusion and to a less extent in mass asymmetric
systems. The characteristics of this GDR are governed by the structure of the
fused system in its preequilibrium phase, like its deformation, rotation and
vibration. In particular, we show that a lowering of the pre-equilibrium GDR
energy is expected as compared to the statistical one. Revisiting experimental
data, we extract an evidence of this lowering for the first time. We also
quantify the fusion-evaporation enhancement due to gamma-ray emission from the
pre-equilibrium GDR. This cooling mechanism along the fusion path may be
suitable to synthesize in the future super heavy elements using radioactive
beams with strong N/Z asymmetries in the entrance channel.

help each other in data transmission. We study different coding strategies in
the single-source single-destination network with many relay nodes. Given the
myriad of ways in which nodes can cooperate, there is a natural routing
problem, i.e., determining an ordered set of nodes to relay the data from the
source to the destination. We find that for a given route, the
decode-and-forward strategy, which is an information theoretic cooperative
coding strategy, achieves rates significantly higher than that achievable by
the usual multi-hop coding strategy, which is a point-to-point non-cooperative
coding strategy. We construct an algorithm to find an optimal route (in terms
of rate maximizing) for the decode-and-forward strategy. Since the algorithm
runs in factorial time in the worst case, we propose a heuristic algorithm that
runs in polynomial time. The heuristic algorithm outputs an optimal route when
the nodes transmit independent codewords. We implement these coding strategies
using practical low density parity check codes to compare the performance of
the strategies on different routes.

coexistence of a predator-prey system. The individuals of each species are
localized over the sites of a lattice and the local stochastic updating rules
are inspired on the processes of the Lotka-Volterra model. Two levels of
mean-field approximations are set up. The simple approximation is equivalent to
an extended patch model, a simple metapopulation model with patches colonized
by prey, patches colonized by predators and empty patches. This approximation
is capable of describing the limited available space for species occupancy. The
pair approximation is moreover able to describe two types of coexistence of
prey and predators: one where population densities are constant in time and
another displaying self-sustained time-oscillations of the population
densities. The oscillations are associated with limit cycles and arise through
a Hopf bifurcation. They are stable against changes in the initial conditions
and, in this sense, they differ from the Lotka-Volterra cycles which depend on
initial conditions. In this respect, the present model is biologically more
realistic than the Lotka-Volterra model.

white dwarfs with a rotational period shorter than the binary orbital period.
Evolutionary theory predicts that IPs with long orbital periods evolve through
the 2-3 hour period gap, but it is very uncertain what the properties of the
resulting objects are. Whilst a relatively large number of long-period IPs are
known, very few of these have short orbital periods. We present phase-resolved
spectroscopy and photometry of SDSS J233325.92+152222.1 and classify it as the
IP with the shortest known orbital period (83.12 +/- 0.09 min), which contains
a white dwarf with a relatively long spin period (41.66 +/- 0.13 min). We
estimate the white dwarf's magnetic moment to be mu(WD) \approx 2 x 10^33 G
cm^3, which is not only similar to three of the other four confirmed
short-period IPs but also to those of many of the long-period IPs. We suggest
that long-period IPs conserve their magnetic moment as they evolve towards
shorter orbital periods. Therefore the dominant population of long-period IPs,
which have white dwarf spin periods roughly ten times shorter than their
orbital periods, will likely end up as short-period IPs like SDSS J2333, with
spin periods a large fraction of their orbital periods.

coupled Fermi liquids the drag resistance is always expected to increase as the
temperature is raised.

hot molecular core stage of high-mass star formation, we observed the
prototypical hot core G29.96-0.02 in the 862mu band with the Submillimeter
Array (SMA) at sub-arcsecond spatial resolution. The observations resolved the
hot molecular core into six submm continuum sources with the finest spatial
resolution of 0.36''x0.25'' (~1800AU) achieved so far. Four of them located
within 7800(AU)^2 comprise a proto-Trapezium system with estimated protostellar
densities of 1.4x0^5 protostars/pc^3. The plethora of ~80 spectral lines allows
us to study the molecular outflow(s), the core kinematics, the temperature
structure of the region as well as chemical effects. The derived hot core
temperatures are of the order 300K. We find interesting chemical spatial
differentiations, e.g., C34S is deficient toward the hot core and is enhanced
at the UCHII/hot core interface, which may be explained by temperature
sensitive desorption from grains and following gas phase chemistry. The
SiO(8-7) emission outlines likely two molecular outflows emanating from this
hot core region. Emission from most other molecules peaks centrally on the hot
core and is not dominated by any individual submm peak. Potential reasons for
that are discussed. A few spectral lines that are associated with the main
submm continuum source, show a velocity gradient perpendicular to the
large-scale outflow. Since this velocity structure comprises three of the
central protostellar sources, this is not a Keplerian disk. While the data are
consistent with a gas core that may rotate and/or collapse, we cannot exclude
the outflow(s) and/or nearby expanding UCHII region as possible alternative
causes of this velocity pattern.

Static fractional charges are confined by a weak linear force, most probably

fine--tune the system to a special point at which fractional charges are

advantages, several conserved quantum numbers are identified.

  Networks",,,,,cs.NI cs.IT math.IT,,"  This paper investigates the many-to-one throughput capacity (and by symmetry,
one-to-many throughput capacity) of IEEE 802.11 multi-hop networks. It has
generally been assumed in prior studies that the many-to-one throughput
capacity is upper-bounded by the link capacity L. Throughput capacity L is not
achievable under 802.11. This paper introduces the notion of ""canonical
networks"", which is a class of regularly-structured networks whose capacities
can be analyzed more easily than unstructured networks. We show that the
throughput capacity of canonical networks under 802.11 has an analytical upper
bound of 3L/4 when the source nodes are two or more hops away from the sink;
and simulated throughputs of 0.690L (0.740L) when the source nodes are many
hops away. We conjecture that 3L/4 is also the upper bound for general
networks. When all links have equal length, 2L/3 can be shown to be the upper
bound for general networks. Our simulations show that 802.11 networks with
random topologies operated with AODV routing can only achieve throughputs far
below the upper bounds. Fortunately, by properly selecting routes near the
gateway (or by properly positioning the relay nodes leading to the gateway) to
fashion after the structure of canonical networks, the throughput can be
improved significantly by more than 150%. Indeed, in a dense network, it is
worthwhile to deactivate some of the relay nodes near the sink judiciously.

simulation is used to investigate the diffusion dynamics in Al80Ni20 melts.
Experimentally, the self-diffusion coefficient of Ni is measured by the

method yields also the interdiffusion coefficient. Whereas the experiments were
done in the normal liquid state, the simulations provided the determination of
both self-diffusion and interdiffusion constants in the undercooled regime as
well. The simulation results show good agreement with the experimental data. In
the temperature range 3000 K >= T >= 715 K, the interdiffusion coefficient is
larger than the self-diffusion constants. Furthermore the simulation shows that
this difference becomes larger in the undercooled regime. This result can be
refered to a relatively strong temperature dependence of the thermodynamic
factor \Phi, which describes the thermodynamic driving force for
interdiffusion. The simulations also indicate that the Darken equation is a
good approximation, even in the undercooled regime. This implies that dynamic
cross correlations play a minor role for the temperature range under
consideration.

formation traces the total star formation and taking into account the radial
variations in the composite stellar populations predicted by the Pipino &
Matteucci (2004) multi-zone photo-chemical evolution code, we compute the
distribution of globular cluster properties as a function of galactocentric
radius. We compare our results to the spectroscopic measurements of globular
clusters in nearby early-type galaxies by Puzia et al. (2006) and show that the
observed multi-modality in globular cluster systems of massive ellipticals can
be, at least partly, ascribed to the radial variation in the mix of stellar
populations. Our model predicts the presence of a super-metal-rich population
of globular clusters in the most massive elliptical galaxies, which is in very
good agreement with the spectroscopic observations. Furthermore, we investigate
the impact of other non-linear mechanisms that shape the metallicity
distribution of globular cluster systems, in particular the role of

a way to decide whether it is birationally conjugate to a group of
automorphisms of a minimal surface.
  In particular, we prove that a finite cyclic group of birational
transformations of the plane is linearisable if and only if none of its
non-trivial elements fix a curve of positive genus. For finite Abelian groups,
there exists only one surprising exception, a group isomorphic to Z/2ZxZ/4Z,
whose non-trivial elements do not fix a curve of positive genus but which is
not conjugate to a group of automorphisms of a minimal rational surface.
  We also give some descriptions of automorphisms (not necessarily of finite
order) of del Pezzo surfaces and conic bundles.

with INTEGRAL and a confirmed member of the new class of High Mass X-ray
Binaries, the Supergiant Fast X-ray Transients (SFXTs). Archival INTEGRAL data
and RXTE observations showed that the outbursts occur with a periodicity of
~330 days. Thus, IGR J11215-5952 is the first SFXT displaying periodic
outbursts, possibly related to the orbital period. We performed a Target of
Opportunity observation with Swift with the main aim of monitoring the source
behaviour around the time of the fifth outburst, expected on 2007 Feb 9. The
source field was observed with Swift twice a day (2ks/day) starting from 4th
February, 2007, until the fifth outburst, and then for ~5 ks a day afterwards,
during a monitoring campaign that lasted 23 days for a total on-source exposure
of ~73 ks. This is the most complete monitoring campaign of an outburst from a
SFXT. The spectrum during the brightest flares is well described by an absorbed
power law with a photon index of 1 and N_H~1 10^22 cm^-2. A 1-10 keV peak
luminosity of ~10^36 erg s^-1 was derived (assuming 6.2 kpc, the distance of
the optical counterpart). These Swift observations are a unique data-set for an
outburst of a SFXT, thanks to the combination of sensitivity and time coverage,
and they allowed a study of IGR J11215-5952 from outburst onset to almost
quiescence. We find that the accretion phase lasts longer than previously
thought on the basis of lower sensitivity instruments observing only the
brightest flares. The observed phenomenology is consistent with a smoothly
increasing flux triggered at the periastron passage in a wide eccentric orbit
with many flares superimposed, possibly due to episodic or inhomogeneous
accretion.

[SIII] (18um/33um) infrared line flux ratios, traditionally used to estimate
the density of the ionized gas, in a sample of 41 Type 1 and Type 2 active
galactic nuclei (AGNs) observed with the Infrared Spectrograph on board
Spitzer. The majority of galaxies with both [NeV] lines detected have observed
[NeV] line flux ratios consistent with or below the theoretical low density
limit, based on calculations using currently available collision strengths and
ignoring absorption and stimulated emission. We find that Type 2 AGNs have
lower line flux ratios than Type 1 AGNs and that all of the galaxies with line
flux ratios below the low density limit are Type 2 AGNs. We argue that
differential infrared extinction to the [NeV] emitting region due to dust in
the obscuring torus is responsible for the ratios below the low density limit
and we suggest that the ratio may be a tracer of the inclination angle of the
torus to our line of sight. Because the temperature of the gas, the amount of
extinction, and the effect of absorption and stimulated emission on the line
ratios are all unknown, we are not able to determine the electron densities
associated with the [NeV] line flux ratios for the objects in our sample. We
also find that the [SIII] emission from the galaxies in our sample is extended
and originates primarily in star forming regions. Since the emission from
low-ionization species is extended, any analysis using line flux ratios from
such species obtained from slits of different sizes is invalid for most nearby
galaxies.

vector bosons caused by spontaneous Lorentz invariance violation (SLIV). To
this end, the SLIV which evolves in a general Yang-Mills type theory with the
nonlinear vector field constraint $Tr(% \boldsymbol{A}_{\mu
}\boldsymbol{A}^{\mu})=\pm M^{2}$ ($M$ is a proposed SLIV scale) imposed is
considered in detail. With an internal symmetry group $G$ having $D$ generators
not only the pure Lorentz symmetry SO(1,3), but the larger accidental symmetry
$SO(D,3D)$ of the SLIV constraint in itself appears to be spontaneously broken
as well. As a result, while the pure Lorentz violation still generates only one
genuine Goldstone vector boson, the accompanying pseudo-Goldstone vector bosons
related to the $SO(D,3D)$ breaking also come into play in the final arrangement
of the entire Goldstone vector field multiplet. Remarkably, they remain
strictly massless, being protected by gauge invariance of the Yang-Mills theory
involved. We show that, although this theory contains a plethora of Lorentz and
$CPT$ violating couplings, they do not lead to physical SLIV effects which turn
out to be strictly cancelled in all the lowest order processes considered.
However, the physical Lorentz violation could appear if the internal gauge
invariance were slightly broken at very small distances influenced by gravity.
For the SLIV scale comparable with the Planck one the Lorentz violation could
become directly observable at low energies.

cross sections on particle production is investigated in heavy ion collisions
($HIC$) at intermediate energies. In particular, using a fully covariant
relativistic transport approach, we see that the density dependence of the {\it
inelastic} cross sections appreciably affects the pion and kaon yields and
their rapidity distributions. However, the $(\pi^{-}/\pi^{+})$- and
$(K^{0}/K^{+})$-ratios depend only moderately on the in-medium behavior of the
inelastic cross sections. This is particularly true for kaon yield ratios,
since kaons are more uniformly produced in high density regions. Kaon
potentials are also suitably evaluated in two schemes, a chiral perturbative
approach and an effective meson-quark coupling method, with consistent results
showing a similar repulsive contribution for $K^{+}$ and $K^{0}$. As a
consequence we expect rather reduced effects on the yield ratios. We conclude
that particle ratios appear to be robust observables for probing the nuclear
equation of state ($EoS$) at high baryon density and, particularly, its
isovector sector.

energy and momentum conservation in the dynamics. The algorithm is tested for a
hysteresis loop reaction model with an without the implementation of the

widthin the framework of the recently proposed renormalizable gauge sector of

for the model containing the usual six representations of matter fields of the
first generation. Even more, the noncommutative part is finite or free of
divergences, showing that perhaps new interaction symmetry exists in the
noncommutative gauge sector of the model. Discovery of such symmetry would be
of tremendous importance in further search for the violation of the Lorentz
invariance at very high energies. Experimental possibilities of Z -> gamma
gamma decay are analyzed and a firm bound to the scale of the noncommutativity
parameter is set around 1 TeV.

expressed as conformal field theory (CFT) correlators, notably the Laughlin
wave function at filling factor $\nu=1/m$ ($m$ odd) and its quasiholes, and the
Pfaffian wave function at $\nu=1/2$ and its quasiholes. We develop a general
scheme for constructing composite-fermion (CF) wave functions from conformal
field theory. Quasiparticles at $\nu=1/m$ are created by inserting anyonic
vertex operators, $P_{\frac{1}{m}}(z)$, that replace a subset of the electron
operators in the correlator. The one-quasiparticle wave function is identical
to the corresponding CF wave function, and the two-quasiparticle wave function
has correct fractional charge and statistics and is numerically almost
identical to the corresponding CF wave function. We further show how to exactly
represent the CF wavefunctions in the Jain series $\nu = s/(2sp+1)$ as the CFT
correlators of a new type of fermionic vertex operators, $V_{p,n}(z)$,
constructed from $n$ free compactified bosons; these operators provide the CFT
representation of composite fermions carrying $2p$ flux quanta in the $n^{\rm
th}$ CF Landau level. We also construct the corresponding quasiparticle- and
quasihole operators and argue that they have the expected fractional charge and
statistics. For filling fractions 2/5 and 3/7 we show that the chiral CFTs that
describe the bulk wave functions are identical to those given by Wen's general
classification of quantum Hall states in terms of $K$-matrices and $l$- and
$t$-vectors, and we propose that to be generally true. Our results suggest a
general procedure for constructing quasiparticle wave functions for other
fractional Hall states, as well as for constructing ground states at filling
fractions not contained in the principal Jain series.

to evaluate the yield of transit surveys in homogeneous stellar systems,

limits imposed by the need for radial velocity follow-up of transit candidates.
New expressions are derived for the different contributions to the noise budget
on transit time-scales and the least-squares detection statistic for box-shaped
transits, and their behaviour as a function of stellar mass is re-examined.
Correlated noise that is constant with apparent stellar magnitude implies a
steep decrease in detection probability at the high mass end which, when
considered jointly with the radial velocity requirements, can severely limit
the potential of otherwise promising surveys in star clusters. However, we find
that small-aperture, wide field surveys may detect hot Neptunes whose radial
velocity signal can be measured with present-day instrumentation in very nearby

interfaces in the presence of a delta-pinning at height zero. There is a
detailed mathematical understanding of the depinning transition in 2 dimensions
without disorder. Then the variance of the interface height w.r.t. the Gibbs
measure stays bounded uniformly in the volume for any positive pinning force
and diverges like the logarithm of the pinning force when it tends to zero.
  How does the presence of a quenched disorder term in the Hamiltonian modify
this transition? We show that an arbitarily weak random field term is enough to
beat an arbitrarily strong delta-pinning in 2 dimensions and will cause
delocalization. The proof is based on a rigorous lower bound for the overlap
between local magnetizations and random fields in finite volume. In 2
dimensions it implies growth faster than the volume which is a contradiction to
localization. We also derive a simple complementary inequality which shows that
in higher dimensions the fraction of pinned sites converges to one when the
pinning force tends to infinity.

grains in SN ejecta, in accordance with current theoretical models. Yet,
observations of the few well studied SNe and SN remnants imply condensation
efficiencies which are about two orders of magnitude smaller. Motivated by this
tension, we have (i) revisited the model of Todini & Ferrara (2001) for dust
formation in the ejecta of core collapse SNe and (ii) followed, for the first
time, the evolution of newly condensed grains from the time of formation to
their survival - through the passage of the reverse shock - in the SN remnant.
We find that 0.1 - 0.6 M_sun of dust form in the ejecta of 12 - 40 M_sun
stellar progenitors. Depending on the density of the surrounding ISM, between
2-20% of the initial dust mass survives the passage of the reverse shock, on
time-scales of about 4-8 x 10^4 yr from the stellar explosion. Sputtering by
the hot gas induces a shift of the dust size distribution towards smaller
grains. The resulting dust extinction curve shows a good agreement with that
derived by observations of a reddened QSO at z =6.2. Stochastic heating of
small grains leads to a wide distribution of dust temperatures. This supports
the idea that large amounts (~ 0.1 M_sun) of cold dust (T ~ 40K) can be present
in SN remnants, without being in conflict with the observed IR emission.

of [hep-ph/0408216] that the high energy evolution with the running coupling
leads to a universal scaling behavior for the dipole scattering amplitude. The
running coupling corrections calculated recently significantly change the shape
of the scaling function as compared to the fixed coupling case leading to a
considerable increase in the anomalous dimension and to a slow-down of the
evolution with rapidity. The difference between the two recent calculations is
due to an extra contribution to the evolution kernel, referred to as the
subtraction term, which arises when running coupling corrections are included.
These subtraction terms were neglected in both recent calculations. We evaluate
numerically the subtraction terms for both calculations, and demonstrate that
when the subtraction terms are added back to the evolution kernels obtained in
the two works the resulting dipole amplitudes agree with each other! We then
use the complete running coupling kernel including the subtraction term to find
the numerical solution of the resulting full non-linear evolution equation with
the running coupling corrections. Again the scaling regime is recovered at very
large rapidity.

the Herbig Ae star HD 163296 obtained with the IRAM/PBI, SMA and VLA arrays
both in continuum and in the 12CO, 13CO and C18O emission lines. Gas and dust
properties have been obtained comparing the observations with self-consistent
disk models for the dust and CO emission. The circumstellar disk is resolved
both in the continuum and in CO. We find strong evidence that the circumstellar
material is in Keplerian rotation around a central star of 2.6 Msun. The disk
inclination with respect to the line of sight is 46+-4 deg with a position
angle of 128+-4 deg. The slope of the dust opacity measured between 0.87 and 7
mm (beta=1) confirms the presence of mm/cm-size grains in the disk midplane.
The dust continuum emission is asymmetric and confined inside a radius of 200
AU while the CO emission extends up to 540 AU. The comparison between dust and
CO temperature indicates that CO is present only in the disk interior. Finally,
we obtain an increasing depletion of CO isotopomers from 12CO to 13CO and C18O.
We argue that these results support the idea that the disk of HD 163296 is
strongly evolved. In particular, we suggest that there is a strong depletion of
dust relative to gas outside 200 AU; this may be due to the inward migration of
large bodies that form in the outer disk or to clearing of a large gap in the
dust distribution by a low mass companion.

is more important in determining the shapes of the Stokes V profiles than the
phase of the wave, contrary to what our simulations show. We also find that
Stokes V asymmetries are very common in the network, and the histograms of the
observed amplitude and area asymmetries differ significantly from the

full simulation studies with state-of-the-art theoretical predictions of MSSM
Higgs-boson properties. The results are interpreted in MSSM benchmark scenarios
in terms of the parameters tan_beta and the Higgs-boson mass scale, M_A. We
study the dependence of the 5 sigma discovery contours in the M_A-tan_beta
plane on variations of the other supersymmetric parameters. The largest effects
arise from a change in the higgsino mass parameter mu, which enters both via
higher-order radiative corrections and via the kinematics of Higgs decays into
supersymmetric particles. While the variation of $\mu$ can shift the
prospective discovery reach (and correspondingly the ``LHC wedge'' region) by
about Delta tan_beta = 10, we find that the discovery reach is rather stable
with respect to the impact of other supersymmetric parameters. Within the
discovery region we analyze the accuracy with which the masses of the heavy
neutral Higgs bosons can be determined. We find that an accuracy of 1-4% should
be achievable, which could make it possible in favourable regions of the MSSM

measure masses with an uncertainty of 0.02 M$_\odot$. The CSPN mass
distribution is sharply peaked at $0.61 \rm M_\odot$. The WD distribution peaks
at lower masses ($0.58 \rm M_\odot$) and shows a much broader range of masses.
Some of the difference can be explained if the early post-AGB evolution is
faster than predicted by the Bl\""ocker tracks. Between 30 and 50 per cent of WD
may avoid the PN phase because of too low mass. However, the discrepancy cannot
be fully resolved and WD mass distributions may have been broadened by
observational or model uncertainties.

conditions is analysed using a continuum Langevin model. If the
electromigration driving force acts in the step up/down direction, and
step-edge diffusion is the dominant mass-transport mechanism, we find that
significant deviations from the usual $t^{1/4}$ scaling of the terrace-width
correlation function occurs for a critical time $\tau$ which is dependent upon
the three energy scales in the problem: $k_{B}T$, the step stiffness, $\gamma$,
and the bias associated with adatom hopping under the influence of an
electromigration force, $\pm \Delta U$. For ($t < \tau$), the correlation
function evolves as a superposition of $t^{1/4}$ and $t^{3/4}$ power laws. For
$t \ge \tau$ a closed form expression can be derived. This behavior is
confirmed by a Monte-Carlo simulation using a discrete model of the step
dynamics. It is proposed that the magnitude of the electromigration force
acting upon an atom at a step-edge can by estimated by a careful analysis of
the statistical properties of step-edge fluctuations on the appropriate
time-scale.

correlation induced by the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect. The steerable
wavelet constructed from the second derivative of a Gaussian allows one to
define three local morphological measures, namely the signed-intensity,
orientation and elongation of local features. Detections of correlation between
the WMAP and NVSS data are made with each of these morphological measures. The
most significant detection is obtained in the correlation of the
signed-intensity of local features at a significance of 99.9%. By inspecting
signed-intensity sky maps, it is possible for the first time to see the
correlation between the WMAP and NVSS data by eye. Foreground contamination and
instrumental systematics in the WMAP data are ruled out as the source of all
significant detections of correlation. Our results provide new insight on the
ISW effect by probing the morphological nature of the correlation induced
between the cosmic microwave background and large scale structure of the
Universe. Given the current constraints on the flatness of the Universe, our
detection of the ISW effect again provides direct and independent evidence for
dark energy. Moreover, this new morphological analysis may be used in future to
help us to better understand the nature of dark energy.

goals: 1) detecting and characterizing low-mass planets increasingly similar to
the Earth, and 2) improving our understanding of planet formation. We present a
new planet detection method that is capable of making large advances towards
both of these objectives and describe a modest network of telescopes that is
able to make the requisite observations. In a system where a known planet
transits its host star, a second planet in that system will cause the time
between transits to vary. These transit timing variations can be used to infer
the orbital elements and mass of the perturbing planet even if it has a mass
that is smaller than the mass of the Earth. This detection technique
complements other techniques because it is most sensitive in mean-motion
resonances where, due to degeneracies, other techniques have reduced
sensitivity. Small ground-based observatories have already exceeded the
photometric precision necessary to detect sub-Earth mass planets. However, TTV
planet searches are currently limited by the relatively small number of
high-precision transit data and insufficient observing time on existing
telescopes. These issues will be compounded as the number of known transiting
planets suitable for TTV study will increase substantially in the near future.
A relatively modest investment in a ground-based network of small ($\sim 0.5
{\rm m}$ telescopes could provide the needed coverage and so dramatically
increase the effectiveness of transit timing observations.

is proposed to calculate the normal modes and mechanical response of proteins
and their supramolecular assemblies. Motivated by the elastic network model,
proteins are modeled as homogeneous isotropic elastic solids with volume
defined by their solvent-excluded surface. The discretized Finite Element
representation is obtained using a surface simplification algorithm that
facilitates the generation of models of arbitrary prescribed spatial
resolution. The procedure is applied to compute the normal modes of a mutant of
T4 phage lysozyme and of filamentous actin, as well as the critical Euler
buckling load of the latter when subject to axial compression. Results compare
favorably with all-atom normal mode analysis, the Rotation Translation Blocks
procedure, and experiment. The proposed methodology establishes a computational
framework for the calculation of protein mechanical response that facilitates
the incorporation of specific atomic-level interactions into the model,
including aqueous-electrolyte-mediated electrostatic effects. The procedure is
equally applicable to proteins with known atomic coordinates as it is to
electron density maps of proteins, protein complexes, and supramolecular
assemblies of unknown atomic structure.

diameter of EUV loops, and we analyze the suitability of the procedure followed
in a previous paper (L\'opez Fuentes, Klimchuk & D\'emoulin 2006) for
characterizing their expansion properties. For the analysis we create different
synthetic loops and we place them on real backgrounds from data obtained with
the Transition Region and Coronal Explorer (\textit{TRACE}). We apply to these
loops the same procedure followed in our previous works, and we compare the
results with real loop observations. We demonstrate that the procedure allows
us to distinguish constant width loops from loops that expand appreciably with
height, as predicted by simple force-free field models. This holds even for
loops near the resolution limit. The procedure can easily determine when loops
are below resolution limit and therefore not reliably measured. We find that
small-scale variations in the measured loop width are likely due to
imperfections in the background subtraction. The greatest errors occur in
especially narrow loops and in places where the background is especially bright
relative to the loop. We stress, however, that these effects do not impact the
ability to measure large-scale variations. The result that observed loops do
not expand systematically with height is robust.

rate of XMPGs suggests this is a powerful method for finding such populations.

luminosities, metallicities and star formation rates of USELs are consistent

surrounding the F2V star HD 15115 using the Hubble Space Telescope in the

property of the HD 15115 disk relative to other debris disks is its extreme
length asymmetry. The east side of the disk is detected to ~315 AU radius,
whereas the west side of the disk has radius >550 AU. We find a blue optical to
near-infrared scattered light color relative to the star that indicates grain
scattering properties similar to the AU Mic debris disk. The existence of a
large debris disk surrounding HD 15115 adds further evidence for membership in
the Beta Pic moving group, which was previously argued based on kinematics
alone. Here we hypothesize that the extreme disk asymmetry is due to dynamical
perturbations from HIP 12545, an M star 0.5 degrees (0.38 pc) east of HD 15115

MUH, ranging from standard physics topics like symmetries, irreducible
representations, units, free parameters, randomness and initial conditions to
broader issues like consciousness, parallel universes and Godel incompleteness.
I hypothesize that only computable and decidable (in Godel's sense) structures

observations presents a unique way to test certain features of string theory.
Current limit on the ratio of tensor to scalar perturbations, r=T/S, is r <
0.3, future detection may take place for r > 10^{-2}-10^{-3}. At present all
known string theory inflation models predict tensor modes well below the level
of detection. Therefore a possible experimental discovery of tensor modes may
present a challenge to string cosmology.
  The strongest bound on r in string inflation follows from the observation
that in most of the models based on the KKLT construction, the value of the
Hubble constant H during inflation must be smaller than the gravitino mass. For
the gravitino mass in the usual range, m_{3/2} < O(1) TeV, this leads to an
extremely strong bound r < 10^{-24}. A discovery of tensor perturbations with r
> 10^{-3} would imply that the gravitinos in this class of models are
superheavy, m_{3/2} > 10^{13} GeV. This would have important implications for
particle phenomenology based on string theory.

704.0648,Kaushik Majumdar,Kaushik Majumdar,Behavioral response to strong aversive stimuli: A neurodynamical model,Submitted to journal,,,,q-bio.NC,,"  In this paper a theoretical model of functioning of a neural circuit during a
behavioral response has been proposed. A neural circuit can be thought of as a
directed multigraph whose each vertex is a neuron and each edge is a synapse.
It has been assumed in this paper that the behavior of such circuits is
manifested through the collective behavior of neurons belonging to that
circuit. Behavioral information of each neuron is contained in the coefficients
of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) over the output spike train. Those
coefficients form a vector in a multidimensional vector space. Behavioral
dynamics of a neuronal network in response to strong aversive stimuli has been
studied in a vector space in which a suitable pseudometric has been defined.
The neurodynamical model of network behavior has been formulated in terms of
existing memory, synaptic plasticity and feelings. The model has an analogy in
classical electrostatics, by which the notion of force and potential energy has
been introduced. Since the model takes input from each neuron in a network and
produces a behavior as the output, it would be extremely difficult or may even
be impossible to implement. But with the help of the model a possible
explanation for an hitherto unexplained neurological observation in human brain
has been offered. The model is compatible with a recent model of sequential
behavioral dynamics. The model is based on electrophysiology, but its relevance
to hemodynamics has been outlined.

of supernova (SN) feedback and study how galactic winds from star-forming
galaxies affect the features of hydrogen (HI) and metal (CIV and OVI)
absorption systems in the intergalactic medium at high redshift. We find that
the outflows tend to escape to low density regions, and hardly affect the dense
filaments visible in HI absorption. As a result, the strength of HI absorption
near galaxies is not reduced by galactic winds, but even slightly increases. We
also find that a lack of HI absorption for lines of sight (LOS) close to
galaxies, as found by Adelberger et al., can be created by hot gas around the
galaxies induced by accretion shock heating. In contrast to HI, metal
absorption systems are sensitive to the presence of winds. The models without
feedback can produce the strong CIV and OVI absorption lines in LOS within 50
kpc from galaxies, while strong SN feedback is capable of creating strong CIV
and OVI lines out to about twice that distance. We also analyze the mean
transmissivity of HI, CIV, and OVI within 1 h$^{-1}$ Mpc from star-forming
galaxies. The probability distribution of the transmissivity of HI is
independent of the strength of SN feedback, but strong feedback produces LOS
with lower transmissivity of metal lines. Additionally, strong feedback can
produce strong OVI lines even in cases where HI absorption is weak. We conclude
that OVI is probably the best tracer for galactic winds at high redshift.

confirmed objects, we find six statistically significant candidate Ly-alpha
emission line objects. The candidates are identified as having wavelengths
close to the DLA line where the background quasar emission is absorbed. In
comparison with the six currently known Ly-alpha emitting DLA galaxies the
candidates have similar line fluxes and line widths, while velocity offsets
between the emission lines and systemic DLA redshifts are larger. The impact
parameters are larger than 10 kpc, and lower column density systems are found
at larger impact parameters. Assuming that a single gas cloud extends from the

the average candidate DLA galaxy is surrounded by neutral gas with an
exponential scale length of ~5 kpc.

compute various low-order lightcurve statistics and use them to select and
study variable sources. We find that 2% of unresolved optical sources brighter
than g=20.5 appear variable at the 0.05 mag level (rms) simultaneously in the g
and r bands. The majority (2/3) of these variable sources are low-redshift (<2)
quasars, although they represent only 2% of all sources in the adopted
flux-limited sample. We find that at least 90% of quasars are variable at the
0.03 mag level (rms) and confirm that variability is as good a method for
finding low-redshift quasars as is the UV excess color selection (at high
Galactic latitudes). We analyze the distribution of lightcurve skewness for
quasars and find that is centered on zero. We find that about 1/4 of the
variable stars are RR Lyrae stars, and that only 0.5% of stars from the main
stellar locus are variable at the 0.05 mag level. The distribution of
lightcurve skewness in the g-r vs. u-g color-color diagram on the main stellar
locus is found to be bimodal (with one mode consistent with Algol-like
behavior). Using over six hundred RR Lyrae stars, we demonstrate rich halo
substructure out to distances of 100 kpc. We extrapolate these results to
expected performance by the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and estimate that
it will obtain well-sampled 2% accurate, multi-color lightcurves for ~2 million
low-redshift quasars, and will discover at least 50 million variable stars.

  Interstellar Hydrogen in the Heliosphere",,10.1051/0004-6361:20078101,,astro-ph,,"  The boundary conditions of the heliosphere are set by the ionization, density
and composition of inflowing interstellar matter. Constraining the properties
of the Local Interstellar Cloud (LIC) at the heliosphere requires radiative
transfer ionization models. We model the background interstellar radiation
field using observed stellar FUV and EUV emission and the diffuse soft X-ray
background. We also model the emission from the boundary between the LIC and
the hot Local Bubble (LB) plasma, assuming that the cloud is evaporating
because of thermal conduction. We create a grid of models covering a plausible
range of LIC and LB properties, and use the modeled radiation field as input to
radiative transfer/thermal equilibrium calculations using the Cloudy code. Data
from in situ observations of He^O, pickup ions and anomalous cosmic rays in the
heliosphere, and absorption line measurements towards epsilon CMa were used to
constrain the input parameters. A restricted range of assumed LIC HI column
densities and LB plasma temperatures produce models that match all the
observational constraints. The relative weakness of the constraints on N(HI)
and T_h contrast with the narrow limits predicted for the H^O and electron
density in the LIC at the Sun, n(H^0) = 0.19 - 0.20 cm^-3, and n(e) = 0.07 +/-
0.01 cm^-3. Derived abundances are mostly typical for low density gas, with
sub-solar Mg, Si and Fe, possibly subsolar O and N, and S about solar; however
C is supersolar. The interstellar gas at the Sun is warm, low density, and
partially ionized, with n(H) = 0.23 - 0.27 cm^-3, T = 6300 K, X(H^+) ~ 0.2, and
X(He^+) ~ 0.4. These results appear to be robust since acceptable models are
found for substantially different input radiation fields. Our results favor low
values for the reference solar abundances for the LIC composition.

suggests low-metallicity to be a condition for a massive star to evolve to the

models are possible. In binary models the progenitor of the GRB is a massive
helium star with a close companion. We find that tidal synchronization during
core-helium burning is reached on a short timescale (less than a few
millennia). However, the strong core-envelope coupling in the subsequent
evolutionary stages is likely to rule out helium stars with main-sequence
companions as progenitors of hypernovae/GRBs. On the other hand, helium stars
in close binaries with a neutron-star or black-hole companion can, despite the
strong core-envelope coupling in the post-helium burning phase, retain
sufficient core angular momentum to produce a hypernova/GRB.

distortions, imposed at the mesoscopic or macroscopic scales, have a dramatic
effect on electronic properties at the atomic scale and on electrical transport
along DNA. Accordingly, a multiscale approach is necessary to capture the
electronic behavior of the stretched DNA helix. To construct such a model, we
begin with accurate density-functional-theory calculations for electronic
states in DNA bases and base pairs in various relative configurations
encountered in the equilibrium and stretched forms. These results are
complemented by semi-empirical quantum mechanical calculations for the states
of a small size [18 base pair poly(CG)-poly(CG)] dry, neutral DNA sequence,
using previously published models for stretched DNA. The calculated electronic
states are then used to parametrize an effective tight-binding model that can
describe electron hopping in the presence of environmental effects, such as the
presence of stray water molecules on the backbone or structural features of the
substrate. These effects introduce disorder in the model hamiltonian which
leads to electron localization. The localization length is smaller by several
orders of magnitude in stretched DNA relative to that in the unstretched
structure.

expands to a full size of J/psi. Such a dynamical evolution process is included
here in calculations for the J/psi number distribution as a function of
transverse momentum and rapidity in central Au-Au collisions at both RHIC and
LHC energies. The ccbar pairs are produced in the initial collision and in the
partonic system during the prethermal and thermal stages through the partonic
channels ab to ccbar [{2S+1}L_J] and ab to ccbar [{2S+1}L_J]x, and then they
dissociate in the latter two stages. Dissociation of ccbar in the medium occurs
via two reactions: (a) color singlet ccbar plus a gluon turns to color octet
ccbar, (b) color octet ccbar plus a gluon persists as color octet. There are
modest yields of ccbar in the prethermal stage at RHIC energy and through the
reactions ab to ccbar [{2S+1}L_J] at LHC energy for partons with large average
momentum in the prethermal stage at both collider energies and in the thermal
stage at LHC energy. Production from the partonic system competes with the
suppression of the initial yield in the deconfined medium. Consequently, a
bulge within -1.5<y<1.5 has been found for the J/psi number distribution and
the ratio of J/psi number distributions for Au-Au collisions to nucleon-nucleon
collisions. This bulge is caused by the partonic system and is thus an
indicator of a deconfined partonic medium. Based on this result we suggest the
rapidity region worth measuring in future experiments at RHIC and LHC to be
-3<y<3.

give an information-theoretic characterization of achievable predictor
performance in terms of conditional distortion-rate functions. The ideas are

1 degree of freedom and without constraint, gives Friedmann equations as the
equation of motion, which describes a mechanical system with a variable mass
object moving in a potential field. After an appropriate transformation of the
scale factor, this system can be further simplified to an object with constant
mass moving in an effective potential field. In this framework, the $\Lambda$
cold dark matter model as the current standard model of cosmology corresponds
to a harmonic oscillator. We further generalize this formalism to take into
account the bulk viscosity and other cases. The Hamiltonian can be quantized
straightforwardly, but this is different from the approach of the
Wheeler-DeWitt equation in quantum cosmology.

transmission that occurs in a parallel array of independently noisy identical
threshold nonlinearities, including model neurons. Unlike most forms of
stochastic resonance, the output response to suprathreshold random input
signals of arbitrary magnitude is improved by the presence of even small
amounts of noise. In this paper the information transmission performance of SSR
in the limit of a large array size is considered. Using a relationship between
Shannon's mutual information and Fisher information, a sufficient condition for
optimality, i.e. channel capacity, is derived. It is shown that capacity is
achieved when the signal distribution is Jeffrey's prior, as formed from the
noise distribution, or when the noise distribution depends on the signal
distribution via a cosine relationship. These results provide theoretical
verification and justification for previous work in both computational
neuroscience and electronics.

investigate the possibility that it may have had its origin in the massive OB
association Cygnus OB2.
  Methods: We present new spectroscopic observations allowing a reliable
spectral classification of the star, and discuss existing MSX observations of
its associated bow shock and astrometric information not previously studied.
  Results: Our observations reveal that BD+43 3654 is a very early and luminous
star of spectral type O4If, with an estimated mass of (70 +/- 15) solar masses
and an age of about 1.6 Myr. The high spatial resolution of the MSX
observations allows us to determine its direction of motion in the plane of the
sky by means of the symmetry axis of the well-defined bow shock, which matches
well the orientation expected from the proper motion. Tracing back its path
across the sky we find that BD+43 3654 was located near the central, densest
region of Cygnus OB2 at a time in the past similar to its estimated age.
  Conclusions: BD+43 3654 turns out to be one of the three most massive runaway
stars known, and it most likely formed in the central region of Cygnus OB2. A
runaway formation mechanism by means of dynamical ejection is consistent with
our results.

procedure, sources of number states leak onto a beam splitter, and the output
ports are monitored by photodetectors. We find that detecting a fixed fraction
of the input at one output port suffices to direct the remainder to the same
port with high probability, however large the initial state. When instead
photons are detected at both ports, Schr\""{o}dinger cat states are produced. We
describe a circuit for making the components of such a state orthogonal, and
another for subsequent conversion to a N00N state. Our approach scales
exponentially better than existing proposals. Important applications include
quantum imaging and metrology.

existence of a partially disordered chiral state at ambient pressure in the

the analysis of the spin-wave spectrum. We demonstrate that the square of the

$<110>$ but not along the $<100>$ direction. It is a result of competition
between the spin-wave interaction and cubic anisotropy. This negative sign
means an instability of the spin wave spectrum for the helix and leads to a
destruction of the helical order, giving rise to the partially disordered state

weighted networks in terms of the generalization of the relevant parameters,
namely average path length, degree distribution and clustering coefficient.
Although the degree distribution and the average path length admit
straightforward generalizations, for the clustering coefficient several
different definitions have been proposed in the literature. We examined the
different definitions and identified the similarities and differences between
them. In order to elucidate the significance of different definitions of the
weighted clustering coefficient, we studied their dependence on the weights of
the connections. For this purpose, we introduce the relative perturbation norm
of the weights as an index to assess the weight distribution. This study
revealed new interesting statistical regularities in terms of the relative
perturbation norm useful for the statistical characterization of weighted
graphs.

used to define a deterministic growth model analogous to internal DLA. We prove
that the asymptotic shape of this model is a Euclidean ball, in a sense which
is stronger than our earlier work. For the shape consisting of $n=\omega_d r^d$
sites, where $\omega_d$ is the volume of the unit ball in $\R^d$, we show that
the inradius of the set of occupied sites is at least $r-O(\log r)$, while the
outradius is at most $r+O(r^\alpha)$ for any $\alpha > 1-1/d$. For a related
model, the divisible sandpile, we show that the domain of occupied sites is a
Euclidean ball with error in the radius a constant independent of the total
mass. For the classical abelian sandpile model in two dimensions, with $n=\pi
r^2$ particles, we show that the inradius is at least $r/\sqrt{3}$, and the
outradius is at most $(r+o(r))/\sqrt{2}$. This improves on bounds of Le Borgne

are necessary to generate CP violation due to the appearance of the relative
phase between their vacuum expectation values.
  In the simplest model, ratios of quark masses and the
Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix including the CP violating phase are
determined by the CKM element |V_{us}| and the ratio of two vacuum expectation

704.0698,Paul Wright,Paul Wright,Rigorous Results for the Periodic Oscillation of an Adiabatic Piston,"Ph.D. dissertation,",,,,math.DS math-ph math.MP,,"  We study a heavy piston of mass $M$ that moves in one dimension. The piston
separates two gas chambers, each of which contains finitely many ideal, unit
mass gas particles moving in $d$ dimensions, where $ d\geq 1$. Using averaging
techniques, we prove that the actual motions of the piston converge in
probability to the predicted averaged behavior on the time scale $M^ {1/2} $
when $M$ tends to infinity while the total energy of the system is bounded and
the number of gas particles is fixed. Neishtadt and Sinai previously pointed
out that an averaging theorem due to Anosov should extend to this situation.
  When $ d=1$, the gas particles move in just one dimension, and we prove that
the rate of convergence of the actual motions of the piston to its averaged
behavior is $\mathcal{O} (M^ {-1/2}) $ on the time scale $M^ {1/2} $. The
convergence is uniform over all initial conditions in a compact set. We also
investigate the piston system when the particle interactions have been
smoothed. The convergence to the averaged behavior again takes place uniformly,
both over initial conditions and over the amount of smoothing.
  In addition, we prove generalizations of our results to $N$ pistons
separating $N+1$ gas chambers. We also provide a general discussion of
averaging theory and the proofs of a number of previously known averaging
results. In particular, we include a new proof of Anosov's averaging theorem
for smooth systems that is primarily due to Dolgopyat.

The Green's tensor approach permits computation of the phase and amplitude

shown that the field diffracted along the interface by the groove is equivalent
to replacing the groove by an oscillating dipolar line source. An analytic
expression is derived from the Green's function formalism, that reproduces well
the asymptotic surface plasmon polariton (SPP) wave as well as the transient
surface wave in the near-zone close to the groove. The agreement between this
model and the full simulation is very good, showing that the transient
""near-zone"" regime does not depend on the precise shape of the groove. Finally,
it is shown that a composite diffractive evanescent wave model that includes
the asymptotic SPP can describe the wavelength evolution in this transient
near-zone. Such a semi-analytical model may be useful for the design and
optimization of more elaborate photonic circuits whose behavior in large part
will be controlled by surface waves.

(SNR) B0104-72.3 in the Small Magellanic Cloud by the Infrared Camera (IRC)
onboard AKARI. An elongated, partially complete shell is detected in all four
observed IRC bands covering 2.6-15 um. The infrared shell surrounds radio,
optical, and X-ray emission associated with the SNR and is probably a radiative
SNR shell. This is the first detection of a SNR shell in this near/mid-infrared
waveband in the Small Magellanic Cloud. The IRC color indicates that the
infrared emission might be from shocked H2 molecules with some possible
contributions from ionic lines. We conclude that B0104-72.3 is a middle-aged
SNR interacting with molecular clouds, similar to the Galactic SNR IC 443. Our
results highlight the potential of AKARI IRC observations in studying SNRs,
especially for diagnosing SNR shocks.

the effects of heterogeneity in modification on the solubility of such

the effect increasing with increasing blockiness. In the limit of extreme
blockiness, the nature of the phase coexistence crosses over to a

the \emph{a priori} unknown shape of an inclusion $\omega$ inside a body
$\Omega$ from boundary measurement. This inverse problem - known as electrical
impedance tomography - has many important practical applications and hence has
focussed much attention during the last years. However, to our best knowledge,
no work has yet considered a second order approach for this problem. This paper
aims to fill that void: we investigate the existence of second order derivative
of the state $u$ with respect to perturbations of the shape of the interface
$\partial\omega$, then we choose a cost function in order to recover the
geometry of $\partial \omega$ and derive the expression of the derivatives
needed to implement the corresponding Newton method. We then investigate the
stability of the process and explain why this inverse problem is severely
ill-posed by proving the compactness of the Hessian at the global minimizer.

we sometimes find that there appears a phase of the orbit in which particle
motion becomes to be nearly regular (the so-called ``stagnant motion'') for a
finite time interval between more strongly chaotic phases. To study how these
different chaotic behaviours affect on observation of gravitational waves, we
investigate a correlation of the particle motion and the waves. We find that
such a difference in chaotic motions reflects on the wave forms and energy
spectra. The character of the waves in the stagnant motion is quite different
from that either in a regular motion or in a more strongly chaotic motion. This
suggests that we may make a distinction between different chaotic behaviours of
the orbit via the gravitational waves.

emitted by this object, however, is inconsistent with a hard state
interpretation. The accretion rate of NGC 3783 (~7% of the Eddington rate) is
similar to that of other AGN with `soft' state PSDs and higher than that at
which the GBH Cyg X-1, with which AGN are often compared, changes between
`hard' and `soft' states (~2% of the Eddington rate). If NGC 3783 really does
have a `hard' state PSD, it would be quite unusual and would indicate that AGN
and GBHs are not quite as similar as we currently believe. Here we present an
improved X-ray PSD of NGC 3783, spanning from ~10^{-8} to ~10^{-3} Hz, based on
considerably extended (5.5 years) RXTE observations combined with two orbits of
continuous observation by XMM-Newton. We show that this PSD is, in fact, well
fitted by a `soft' state model which has only one break, at high frequencies.
Although a `hard' state model can also fit the data, the improvement in fit by
adding a second break at low frequency is not significant. Thus NGC 3783 is not
unusual. These results leave Arakelian 564 as the only AGN which shows a second
break at low frequencies, although in that case the very high accretion rate
implies a `very high', rather than `hard' state PSD. The break frequency found
in NGC 3783 is consistent with the expectation based on comparisons with other
AGN and GBHs, given its black hole mass and accretion rate.

the compact dimension, but vanishing angular momentum. These black holes are
stationary, but non-rotating. We derive the first law for these spacetimes and
find that the parameter conjugate to variations in the length of the compact
direction is an effective tension, which generally differs from the ADM
tension. For the boosted black string, this effective tension is always
positive, while the ADM tension is negative for large boost parameter. We also
derive two Smarr formulas, one that follows from time translation invariance,
and a second one that holds only in the case of exact translation symmetry in
the compact dimension. Finally, we show that the `tension first law' derived by
Traschen and Fox in the static case has the form of a thermodynamic Gibbs-Duhem
relation and give its extension in the stationary, non-rotating case.

704.073,Hamed Haddadi MSc MIEE,"Hamed Haddadi, Raul Landa, Miguel Rio, Saleem Bhatti",Revisiting the Issues On Netflow Sample and Export Performance,,,,,cs.PF cs.NI,,"  The high volume of packets and packet rates of traffic on some router links
makes it exceedingly difficult for routers to examine every packet in order to
keep detailed statistics about the traffic which is traversing the router.
Sampling is commonly applied on routers in order to limit the load incurred by
the collection of information that the router has to undertake when evaluating
flow information for monitoring purposes. The sampling process in nearly all
cases is a deterministic process of choosing 1 in every N packets on a
per-interface basis, and then forming the flow statistics based on the
collected sampled statistics. Even though this sampling may not be significant
for some statistics, such as packet rate, others can be severely distorted.
However, it is important to consider the sampling techniques and their relative
accuracy when applied to different traffic patterns. The main disadvantage of
sampling is the loss of accuracy in the collected trace when compared to the
original traffic stream. To date there has not been a detailed analysis of the
impact of sampling at a router in various traffic profiles and flow criteria.
In this paper, we assess the performance of the sampling process as used in
NetFlow in detail, and we discuss some techniques for the compensation of loss
of monitoring detail.

keV band from the HELLAS2XMM survey.
  Methods: We use IRAC and MIPS 24 micron observations, along with optical and
Ks-band photometry, to obtain the SEDs of the sources. The observed SEDs are
modeled using a combination of an elliptical template and torus emission (using
the phenomenological templates of Silva et al. 2004) for six sources associated
with passive galaxies; for two point-like sources, the empirical SEDs of red
quasars are adopted. The bolometric luminosities and the M_BH-L_K relation are
used to provide an estimate of the masses and Eddington ratios of the black
holes residing in these AGN.
  Results: All of our sources are detected in the IRAC and MIPS (at 24 micron)
bands. The SED modeling described above is in good agreement with the observed
near- and mid-infrared data. The derived bolometric luminosities are in the
range ~10^45-10^47 erg s^-1, and the median 2--10 keV bolometric correction is
~25, consistent with the widely adopted value derived by Elvis et al. (1994).
For the objects with elliptical-like profiles in the K_s band, we derive high
stellar masses (0.8-6.2)X10^11 Mo, black hole masses in the range
(0.2-2.5)X10^9 Mo, and Eddington ratios L/L_Edd<0.1, suggesting a low-accretion

introduced. We use a ``natural'' refinement equation whose solution (a
refinable function) is the characteristic function of the unit disc. This
equation reflects the fact that the characteristic function of the unit disc is
the sum of $p$ characteristic functions of disjoint discs of radius $p^{-1}$.
The case $p=2$ is studied in detail. Our MRA is a 2-adic analog of the real
Haar MRA. But in contrast to the real setting, the refinable function
generating our Haar MRA is periodic with period 1, which never holds for real
refinable functions. This fact implies that there exist infinity many different
2-adic orthonormal wavelet bases in ${\cL}^2(\bQ_2)$ generated by the same Haar
MRA. All of these bases are constructed. Since $p$-adic pseudo-differential
operators are closely related to wavelet-type bases, our bases can be
intensively used for applications.

found that the vertical velocity dispersion of deep-MOND disks can be much

Our knowledge of the mechanisms governing the underlying community dynamics is
limited, but is essential for a deeper understanding of the development and
self-optimisation of the society as a whole. We have developed a new algorithm

the time dependence of overlapping communities on a large scale and as such, to
uncover basic relationships characterising community evolution. Our focus is on
networks capturing the collaboration between scientists and the calls between
mobile phone users. We find that large groups persist longer if they are
capable of dynamically altering their membership, suggesting that an ability to
change the composition results in better adaptability. The behaviour of small
groups displays the opposite tendency, the condition for stability being that
their composition remains unchanged. We also show that the knowledge of the

the community's lifetime. These findings offer a new view on the fundamental
differences between the dynamics of small groups and large institutions.

state, i.e. a state in which the properties of the global system are well
defined but the properties of each subsystem are not. Entanglement is at the
heart of quantum physics, both for its conceptual foundations and for
applications in information processing and quantum communication. Remarkably,
entanglement can be ""swapped"": if one prepares two independent entangled pairs
A1-A2 and B1-B2, a joint measurement on A1 and B1 (called a ""Bell-State
Measurement"", BSM) has the effect of projecting A2 and B2 onto an entangled
state, although these two particles have never interacted or shared any common
past[1,2]. Experiments using twin photons produced by spontaneous parametric
down-conversion (SPDC) have already demonstrated entanglement swapping[3-6],
but here we present its first realization using continuous wave (CW) sources,
as originally proposed[2]. The challenge was to achieve sufficiently sharp
synchronization of the photons in the BSM. Using narrow-band filters, the
coherence time of the photons that undergo the BSM is significantly increased,
exceeding the temporal resolution of the detectors. Hence pulsed sources can be
replaced by CW sources, which do not require any synchronization[6,7], allowing
for the first time the use of completely autonomous sources. Our experiment
exploits recent progress in the time precision of photon detectors, in the
efficiency of photon pair production by SPDC with waveguides in nonlinear
crystals[8], and in the stability of narrow-band filters. This approach is
independent of the form of entanglement; we employed time-bin entangled
photons[9] at telecom wavelengths. Our setup is robust against thermal or
mechanical fluctuations in optical fibres thanks to cm-long coherence lengths.

local interactions. This locality is shown to hold also for the helicity flux;
moreover, every weak solution of the Euler equations that belongs to

strong locality of the enstrophy holds only in the ultraviolet range.

dramatically change the tunneling behavior. We predict that in general the

collapse and revival of the tunneling occurs. Accessing the internal degrees of

the locality loophole) this local model can violate Bell's inequality, without
making any appeal to detector inefficiencies.
  We analyze a possible experimental configuration appropriate to massive
two-particle singlet wavefunctions and find that as long as the particles are
not ultra-relativistic, a locality loophole exists and Dirac wave(s) can
propagate from Alice or Bob's changing magnetic field, through space, to the
other detector, arriving before the particle and thereby allowing a local
interpretation to the 2-particle de Broglie-Bohm trajectories.
  We also propose a physical effect due to changing magnetic fields in a
Stern-Gerlach EPR setup that will throw away events and create a detector
loophole in otherwise perfectly efficient detectors, an effect that is only
significant for near-luminal particles that might otherwise close the locality
loophole.

the few largest eigenvalues deviate from the bulk of the spectrum predicted by
random matrix theory, but they are far fewer in number compared to, e.g., NYSE.
We show this to be due to the relative weakness of intra-sector interactions
between stocks, compared to the market mode, by modeling stock price dynamics
with a two-factor model. Our results suggest that the emergence of an internal
structure comprising multiple groups of strongly coupled components is a
signature of market development.

from the COMBO-17 survey. A total of 570 galaxies with photometric redshifts in
the range 0.155 < z_phot < 0.185 are visually classified by three independent
classifiers to M_V=-18. These morphological classifications are compared to
local galaxy density, distance from the nearest cluster centre, local surface
mass density from weak lensing, and photometric classification. At high local
galaxy densities, log(Sigma_10 /Mpc^2) > 1.5, a classical morphology-density
relation is found. A correlation is also found between morphology and local
projected surface mass density, but no trend is observed with distance to the
nearest cluster. This supports the finding that local environment is more
important to galaxy morphology than global cluster properties. The breakdown of
the morphological catalogue by colour shows a dominance of blue galaxies in the
galaxies displaying late-type morphologies and a corresponding dominance of red
galaxies in the early-type population. Using the 17-band photometry from
COMBO-17, we further split the supercluster red sequence into old passive
galaxies and galaxies with young stars and dust according to the prescription
of Wolf et al. (2005). We find that the dusty star-forming population describes
an intermediate morphological group between late-type and early-type galaxies,
supporting the hypothesis that field and group spiral galaxies are transformed
into S0s and, perhaps, ellipticals during cluster infall.

toroidal, then any $G$-Schubert variety in $X$ admits a stable Frobenius

By introducing only one additional parameter, the length of the system, our
code can simulate variability properly at Compton dominated stages, a situation
typical of flaring systems. As a first application, we were able to reproduce

boundary treatment, the full solutions including constraint violations and
extracted gravitational waves are compared to those of the reference solution,
thereby assessing the reflections caused by the artificial boundary. These
tests use a first-order generalized harmonic formulation of the Einstein
equations. Constraint-preserving boundary conditions for this system are
reviewed, and an improved boundary condition on the gauge degrees of freedom is
presented. Alternate boundary conditions evaluated here include freezing the
incoming characteristic fields, Sommerfeld boundary conditions, and the
constraint-preserving boundary conditions of Kreiss and Winicour. Rather
different approaches to boundary treatments, such as sponge layers and spatial
compactification, are also tested. Overall the best treatment found here
combines boundary conditions that preserve the constraints, freeze the
Newman-Penrose scalar Psi_0, and control gauge reflections.

bursts (GRBs) with known redshift, all of them detected by the Swift satellite.
Due to the narrow energy range (15-150 keV) of the Swift-BAT detector, the
spectral fitting is reliable only for fitting models with 2 or 3 parameters. As
high uncertainty and correlation among the errors is expected, a careful
analysis of the errors is necessary. We fit both the power law (PL, 2
parameters) and cut--off power law (CPL, 3 parameters) models to the
time-integrated spectra of the 47 bursts, and present the corresponding
parameters, their uncertainties, and the correlations among the uncertainties.
The CPL model is reliable only for 29 bursts for which we estimate the nuf_nu
peak energy Epk. For these GRBs, we calculate the energy fluence and the rest-
frame isotropic-equivalent radiated energy, Eiso, as well as the propagated
uncertainties and correlations among them. We explore the distribution of our

significant correlation between these two quantities (the ""Amati"" relation) and
we verify that, within the uncertainty limits, no outliers are present. We also
fit the spectra to a Band model with the high energy power law index frozen to

correlation between star formation rate and gas surface or volume density,
depend on the molecular line chosen to trace the gas. We show that, for lines
that can be excited at low temperatures, the KS law depends on how the line
critical density compares to the median density in a galaxy's star-forming
molecular clouds. High critical density lines trace regions with similar
physical properties across galaxy types, and this produces a linear correlation
between line luminosity and star formation rate. Low critical density lines
probe regions whose properties vary across galaxies, leading to a star
formation rate that varies superlinearly with line luminosity. We show that a
simple model in which molecular clouds are treated as isothermal and homogenous
can quantitatively reproduce the observed correlations between galactic
luminosities in far infrared and in the CO(1->0) and HCN(1->0) lines, and
naturally explains why these correlations have different slopes. We predict
that IR-line luminosity correlations should change slope for galaxies in which
the median density is close to the line critical density. This prediction may
be tested by observations of lines such as HCO^+(1->0) with intermediate
critical densities, or by HCN(1->0) observations of intensely star-forming high
redshift galaxies with very high densities. Recent observations by Gao et al.
hint at just such a change in slope. We argue that deviations from linearity in
the HCN(1->0)-IR correlation at high luminosity are consistent with the
assumption of a constant star formation efficiency.

constraints on cases where only a fraction of the dark matter strongly

corresponding to the exact chiral symmetry of staggered quarks. The treatment
assumes the validity of the standard prescription for representing the
staggered ``fourth root trick'' within \schpt by insertions of factors of 1/4
for each sea quark loop. Our calculation is based on an existing partially
quenched continuum chiral perturbation theory calculation with degenerate sea
quarks by Becirevic, Prelovsek and Zupan, which we generalize to the staggered
(and non-degenerate) case. As a by-product, we obtain the continuum partially
quenched results with non-degenerate sea quarks. We analyze the effects of
non-leading chiral terms, and find a relation among the coefficients governing
the analytic valence mass dependence at this order. Our results are useful in
analyzing lattice computations of form factors $B\to\pi$ and $D\to K$ when the
light quarks are simulated with the staggered action.

recovers information about fluctuations lost in passing to the reduced density
matrix. For the case of fluctuations arising from a classical probability
distribution, the hierarchy is formed from expectations of products of pure
state density matrix elements, and can be compactly summarized by a simple
generating function. For the case of quantum fluctuations arising when a
quantum system interacts with a quantum environment in an overall pure state,
the corresponding hierarchy is defined as the environmental trace of products
of system matrix elements of the full density matrix. Only the lowest member of
the quantum noise hierarchy is directly experimentally measurable. The unit
trace and idempotence properties of the pure state density matrix imply descent
relations for the tensor hierarchies, that relate the order $n$ tensor, under
contraction of appropriate pairs of tensor indices, to the order $n-1$ tensor.
As examples to illustrate the classical probability distribution formalism, we
consider a quantum system evolving by It\^o stochastic and by jump process
Schr\""odinger equations. As examples to illustrate the corresponding trace
formalism in the quantum fluctuation case, we consider collisional Brownian
motion of an infinite mass Brownian particle, and the weak coupling Born-Markov
master equation. In different specializations, the latter gives the hierarchies
generalizing the quantum optical master equation and the Caldeira--Leggett
master equation. As a further application of the density tensor, we contrast
stochastic Schr\""odinger equations that reduce and that do not reduce the state
vector, and discuss why a quantum system coupled to a quantum environment
behaves like the latter.

the particle's world line; this is handled mode-by-mode via the mode-sum

the numerical method, various numerical tests, and a sample of results for
mildly eccentric orbits as well as ``zoom-whirl'' orbits.

complete/correct two oversights in that paper.
  The first is to note that in that paper a general nonimmersion result was
stated which yielded new nonimmersions for RP^n with n as small as 48, and yet
it was stated there that the first new result occurred when n=1536. Here we
give a simple proof of those overlooked results.
  Secondly, we fill in a gap in the proof of the 2002 paper. There it was
claimed that an axial map f must satisfy f^*(X)=X_1+X_2. We realized recently
that this is not clear. However, here we show that it is true up multiplication
by a unit in the appropriate ring, and so we retrieve all the nonimmersion
results claimed in the original paper.

  Corrected References","Phys.Rev.D76:064019,2007",10.1103/PhysRevD.76.064019,,astro-ph gr-qc,,"  The nonlinear saturation of the r-mode instability and its effects on the
spin evolution of Low Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXBs) are modeled using the triplet
of modes at the lowest parametric instability threshold. We solve numerically
the coupled equations for the three mode amplitudes in conjunction with the
spin and temperature evolution equations. We observe that very quickly the mode
amplitudes settle into quasi-stationary states. Once these states are reached,
the mode amplitudes can be found algebraically and the system of equations is
reduced from eight to two equations: spin and temperature evolution.
Eventually, the system may reach thermal equilibrium and either (1) undergo a
cyclic evolution with a frequency change of at most 10%, (2) evolve toward a
full equilibrium state in which the accretion torque balances the gravitational
radiation emission, or (3) enter a thermogravitational runaway on a very long
timescale of about $10^6$ years. Alternatively, a faster thermal runaway
(timescale of about 100 years) may occur. The sources of damping considered are
shear viscosity, hyperon bulk viscosity and boundary layer viscosity. We vary
proprieties of the star such as the hyperon superfluid transition temperature
T_c, the fraction of the star that is above the threshold for direct URCA
reactions, and slippage factor, and map the different scenarios we obtain to
ranges of these parameters. For all our bound evolutions the r-mode amplitude
remains small $\sim 10^{-5}$. The spin frequency is limited by boundary layer
viscosity to $\nu_{max} \sim 800 Hz [S_{ns}/(M_{1.4} R_6)]^{4/11} T_8^{-2/11}$.
We find that for $\nu > 700$ Hz the r-mode instability would be active for
about 1 in 1000 LMXBs and that only the gravitational waves from LMXBs in the
local group of galaxies could be detected by advanced LIGO interferometers.

state gives the auction outcome while simultaneously destroying the
superposition. Thus non-winning bids are never revealed. Participants can use
entanglement to arrange for correlations among their bids, with the assurance
that this entanglement is not observable by others. The protocol is useful for
information hiding applications, such as partnership bidding with allocative
externality or concerns about revealing bidding preferences. The protocol
applies to a variety of auction types, e.g., first or second price, and to
auctions involving either a single item or arbitrary bundles of items (i.e.,
combinatorial auctions). We analyze the game-theoretical behavior of the
quantum protocol for the simple case of a sealed-bid quantum, and show how a
suitably designed adiabatic search reduces the possibilities for bidders to
game the auction. This design illustrates how incentive rather that
computational constraints affect quantum algorithm choices.

additional phase shift of $\pi$. We reinterpret this phenomenon in terms of
geometric phase.
  We consider an idealized hetero-junction superconductor with pure s-wave and

may not even be available in closed form. Although closure dynamics introduce
statistical assumptions of unknown validity, they can have significant
computational advantages as they typically have fewer degrees of freedom and
may be much less stiff than the original detailed model. The closure method can
in principle be applied to a wide class of nonlinear problems, including
strongly-coupled systems (either deterministic or stochastic) for which there
may be no scale separation. We demonstrate the equation-free approach for
implementing entropy-based Eyink-Levermore closures on a nonlinear stochastic

suffers a loss compared to centralized strategies that select relays with the
best channel gain to the destination. This paper closes the performance gap by
adding another level of channel feedback to the decentralized relay selection
problem. It is demonstrated that only one additional bit of feedback is
necessary for good throughput performance. The performance impact of varying
key parameters such as the number of relays and the channel feedback threshold
is discussed. An accompanying bit error rate analysis demonstrates the
importance of relay selection.

surveys have been the backbone of astronomy, and the main engine of discovery,
as we have mapped the sky at every possible wavelength. Surveys are an
efficient use of resources. They are important as a fundamental resource; to
map intrinsically large structures; to gain the necessary statistics to address
some problems; and to find very rare objects. I summarise major recent wide
field surveys - 2MASS, SDSS, 2dfGRS, and UKIDSS - and look at examples of the
exciting science they have produced, covering the structure of the Milky Way,
the measurement of cosmological parameters, the creation of a new field
studying substellar objects, and the ionisation history of the Universe. I then
look briefly at upcoming projects in the optical-IR survey arena - VISTA,
PanSTARRS, WISE, and LSST. Finally I ask, now we have opened up essentially all
wavelength windows, whether the exploration of survey discovery space is ended.
I examine other possible axes of discovery space, and find them mostly to be
too expensive to explore or otherwise unfruitful, with two exceptions : the
first is the time axis, which we have only just begun to explore properly; and
the second is the possibility of neutrino astrophysics.

  2006",,,,astro-ph,,"  Massive X-ray binaries are formed by a compact object that accretes matter
from the stellar wind of an early-type donor star. In some of these systems,
called microquasars, relativistic jets are launched from the surroundings of
the compact object. Such jets interact with the photon field of the companion
star, the stellar wind, and, at large distances, with the interstellar medium.
In this paper I will review the main results of such interactions with
particular emphasis on the production of high-energy photons and neutrinos. The
case of some specific systems, like LS I +61 303, will be discussed in some
detail. Prospects for future observations at different wavelengths of this type
of objects will be presented.

0.457 and 1.807) and metallicity between [Fe/H] = -0.82 and 0.6. We obtained
medium resolution echelle spectra using the 2.15-m telescope at the argentinian
observatory CASLEO. The observations have been performed periodically since
1999. The spectra were calibrated in wavelength and in flux. A definition of
the pseudo-continuum level is found for all our observations. We also define a
continuum level for calibration purposes. The equivalent width of the D lines
is computed in detail for all our spectra and related to the colour index (B-V)
of the stars. When possible, we perform a careful comparison with previous
studies. Finally, we construct a spectral index (R_D') as the ratio between the
flux in the D lines, and the bolometric flux. We find that, once corrected for
the photospheric contribution, this index can be used as a chromospheric
activity indicator in stars with a high level of activity. Additionally, we
find that combining some of our results, we obtain a method to calibrate in
flux stars of unknown colour.

ergospheric disk is prominent in the 3-D simulations and is responsible for
greatly enhanced Poynting flux emission. Any large scale poloidal magnetic flux
that is trapped in the equatorial region leads to an enormous release of
electromagnetic energy that dwarfs the jet energy produced by magnetic flux
threading the event horizon. The implication is that magnetic flux threading
the equatorial plane of the ergosphere is a likely prerequisite for the central
engine of powerful FRII quasars.

Keplerian rotation around a central mass observed edge-on. The absorption
coefficient within the ring is assumed to follow a power law dependence with
the distance from the central mass as, k=k0r^{-q}. We have calculated
position-velocity diagrams for the most intense maser features, for different
values of the exponent q. We have found that, depending on the value of q,
these diagrams can be qualitatively different. The most intense maser emission
at a given velocity can either come mainly from regions close to the inner or
outer edges of the amplifying ring or from the line perpendicular to the line
of sight and passing through the central mass (as is commonly assumed).
Particularly, when q>1 the position-velocity diagram is qualitatively similar
to the one observed for the water maser emission in the nucleus of the galaxy
NGC 4258. In the context of this simple model, we conclude that in this object
the absorption coefficient depends on the radius of the amplifying ring as a
decreasing function, in order to have significant emission coming from the
inner edge of the ring.

relative to the turnoff. The number of red giants (relative to main sequence
turnoff stars) is in excellent agreement with stellar models from the
Yonsei-Yale and Teramo groups, and slightly high compared to Victoria-Regina
models. This adds to evidence that an abnormally large ratio of red giant to
main-sequence stars is not correlated with cluster metallicity. We discuss
theoretical predictions from different research groups and find that the
inclusion or exclusion of helium diffusion and strong limit Coulomb
interactions may be partly responsible.
  We also examine indicators of dynamical history: the mass function exponent
and the blue straggler frequency. NGC 5466 has a very shallow mass function,
consistent with large mass loss and recently-discovered tidal tails. The blue
straggler sample is significantly more centrally concentrated than the HB or
RGB stars. We see no evidence of an upturn in the blue straggler frequency at
large distances from the center. Dynamical friction timescales indicate that
the stragglers should be more concentrated if the cluster's present density
structure has existed for most of its history. NGC 5466 also has an unusually
low central density compared to clusters of similar luminosity. In spite of

in superconductors with honeycomb and kagome pinning arrays. We find that a
variety of novel vortex crystal states can be stabilized at integer and
fractional matching field densities. The honeycomb and kagome pinning arrays
produce considerably more pronounced commensuration peaks in the critical
depinning force than triangular pinning arrays, and also cause additional peaks
at noninteger matching fields where a portion of the vortices are located in
the large interstitial regions of the pinning lattices. For the honeycomb
pinning array, we find matching effects of equal strength at most fillings
B/B_\phi=n/2 for n>2, where n is an integer, in agreement with recent
experiments. For kagome pinning arrays, pronounced matching effects generally
occur at B/B_\phi=n/3 for n>3, while for triangular pinning arrays pronounced
matching effects are observed only at integer fillings B/B_\phi=n. At the
noninteger matching field peaks in the honeycomb and kagome pinning arrays, the
interstitial vortices are arranged in dimer, trimer, and higher order n-mer
states that have an overall orientational order. We call these n-mer states
""vortex molecular crystals"" and ""vortex plastic crystals"" since they are
similar to the states recently observed in colloidal molecular crystal systems.
We argue that the vortex molecular crystals have properties in common with
certain spin systems such as Ising and n-state Potts models. We show that
kagome and honeycomb pinning arrays can be useful for increasing the critical
current above that of purely triangular pinning arrays.

detection techniques does not allow routine discovery of Earth-sized bodies in
binary systems. However, with the advancement of new techniques, and with the
recent launch of CoRoT and the launch of Kepler in late 2008, the detection of
more planets (possibly terrestrial-class objects) in such systems is on the
horizon. Theoretical studies and numerical modeling of terrestrial and
habitable planet formation are, therefore, necessary to gain fundamental
insights into the prospects for life in such systems and have great strategic
impact on NASA science and missions.

For average lobe magnetic fields of >~0.3-1 micro-G, the lobe spectra are
predicted to extend into the soft gamma-rays making them likely detectable with
the GLAST LAT. If detected, their large angular extents (~1 deg and 8 deg) will
make it possible to ``image'' the radio lobes in gamma-rays. Similarly, this
process operates in more distant radio galaxies and the possibility that such
systems will be detected as unresolved gamma-ray sources with GLAST is briefly
considered.

  Distributions",Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory,,,,cs.IT math.IT,,"  We study universal compression of sequences generated by monotonic
distributions. We show that for a monotonic distribution over an alphabet of
size $k$, each probability parameter costs essentially $0.5 \log (n/k^3)$ bits,
where $n$ is the coded sequence length, as long as $k = o(n^{1/3})$. Otherwise,
for $k = O(n)$, the total average sequence redundancy is $O(n^{1/3+\epsilon})$
bits overall. We then show that there exists a sub-class of monotonic
distributions over infinite alphabets for which redundancy of
$O(n^{1/3+\epsilon})$ bits overall is still achievable. This class contains
fast decaying distributions, including many distributions over the integers and
geometric distributions. For some slower decays, including other distributions
over the integers, redundancy of $o(n)$ bits overall is achievable, where a
method to compute specific redundancy rates for such distributions is derived.
The results are specifically true for finite entropy monotonic distributions.
Finally, we study individual sequence redundancy behavior assuming a sequence
is governed by a monotonic distribution. We show that for sequences whose
empirical distributions are monotonic, individual redundancy bounds similar to
those in the average case can be obtained. However, even if the monotonicity in
the empirical distribution is violated, diminishing per symbol individual
sequence redundancies with respect to the monotonic maximum likelihood
description length may still be achievable.

$<qq>$ in vacuum is generally made by relativistic effective potentials in the
mean field approximation in 2D, 3D and 4D models with two flavor and $N_c$
color massless fermions. It is found that in ground states of these models,
interplay between the two condensates mainly depend on the ratio $G_S/H_S$ for
2D and 4D case or $G_S/H_P$ for 3D case, where $G_S$, $H_S$ and $H_P$ are
respectively the coupling constants in a scalar $(\bar{q}q)$, a scalar $(qq)$
and a pseudoscalar $(qq)$ channel. In ground states of all the models, only
pure $<\bar{q}q>$ condensates could exist if $G_S/H_S$ or $G_S/H_P$ is bigger
than the critical value $2/N_c$, the ratio of the color numbers of the fermions
entering into the condensates $<qq>$ and $<\bar{q}q>$. As $G_S/H_S$ or
$G_S/H_P$ decreases to the region below $2/N_c$, differences of the models will
manifest themselves. Depending on different models, and also on $N_c$ in 3D
model, one will have or have no the coexistence phase of the two condensates,
besides the pure $<qq>$ condensate phase. The $G_S-H_S$ (or $G_S-H_P$) phase
diagrams in these models are given. The results also implicate a real
constraint on two-flavor QCD-analogous NJL model.

p-wave-particles rotating reversely appears to be a basic mode. The fluctuation
of many of these excited pairs provides a mechanism of oscillation, the states
can be thereby classified into oscillation bands. The particle correlation is
studied intuitively via the two-body densities. Bose-clustering originating
from the symmetrization of wave functions is found, which leads to the
appearance of 1-, 2-, and 3-cluster structures. The motion is divided into
being collective and relative, this leads to the establishment of a relation
between the very high vortex states and the low-lying states.

elliptical galaxies was a major surprise in 1969. While it is now clear that
this UV excess is caused by an old population of hot helium-burning stars
without large hydrogen-rich envelopes, rather than young stars, their origin
has remained a mystery. Here we show that these stars most likely lost their
envelopes because of binary interactions, similar to the hot subdwarf
population in our own Galaxy. We have developed an evolutionary population
synthesis model for the far-UV excess of elliptical galaxies based on the
binary model developed by Han et al (2002, 2003) for the formation of hot
subdwarfs in our Galaxy. Despite its simplicity, it successfully reproduces
most of the properties of elliptical galaxies with a UV excess: the range of
observed UV excesses, both in $(1550-V)$ and $(2000-V)$, and their evolution
with redshift. We also present colour-colour diagrams for use as diagnostic
tools in the study of elliptical galaxies. The model has major implications for
understanding the evolution of the UV excess and of elliptical galaxies in
general. In particular, it implies that the UV excess is not a sign of age, as
had been postulated previously, and predicts that it should not be strongly
dependent on the metallicity of the population, but exists universally from
dwarf ellipticals to giant ellipticals.

strongly depend on the number of carriers confined in the dot. We identify the

discuss recent experiments on triplet-singlet transitions in GaAs dots subject

known as IntraDay Variability, can be explained in at least some sources by a
source-extrinsic effect, in which the variations are interpreted as
scintillation of radio waves caused by the turbulent ISM of the Milky Way. One
of the most convincing observational arguments in favour of propagation-induced
variability is the so called annual modulation of the characteristic
variability time-scale, which is due to the orbital motion of the Earth. Data
for the recently discovered and highly variable IDV source J1128+5925 are
presented. We study the frequency and time dependence of the IDV in this
compact quasar. We measure the characteristic variability time-scale of the IDV
throughout the year, and analyze whether the observed changes in the
variability time-scale are consistent with annual modulation. We monitored the
flux density variability of J1128+5925 with dense time sampling between 2.7 and
10.45GHz with the 100m Effelsberg radio telescope of the MPIfR and with the 25m
Urumqi radio telescope. From ten observing sessions, we determine the
variability characteristics and time-scales. The observed pronounced changes of
the variability time-scale of J1128+5925 are modelled with an anisotropic
annual modulation model. The observed frequency dependence of the variation is
in good agreement with the prediction from interstellar scintillation. Adopting
a simple model for the annual modulation model and using also the frequency
dependence of the IDV, we derive a lower limit to the distance of the
scattering screen and an upper limit to the scintillating source size. The
latter is found to be consistent with the measured core size from VLBI.

used to map solid masses onto outcomes, and the frequencies of all classes are
correctly predicted. The differing dependences on metallicity for forming

extrapolation, around two-thirds of stars have enough solids to form Earth-like
planets, and a high rate is supported by the first detections of low-mass

been investigated by Cr K-edge Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS)
and X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES) spectroscopies.
First-principles computations of the structural relaxation and of the XANES
spectrum have been performed, with a good agreement to the experiment. The Cr-O
distance is close to that in MgCr2O4, indicating a full relaxation of the first
neighbors, and the second shell of Al atoms relaxes partially. These
observations demonstrate that Vegard's law is not obeyed in the MgAl2O4-MgCr2O4
solid solution. Despite some angular site distortion, the local D3d symmetry of
the B-site of the spinel structure is retained during the substitution of Cr
for Al. Here, we show that the relaxation is accomodated by strain-induced bond
buckling, with angular tilts of the Mg-centred tetrahedra around the Cr-centred
octahedron. By contrast, there is no significant alteration of the angles
between the edge-sharing octahedra, which build chains aligned along the three
four-fold axes of the cubic structure.

properties of bibliometric indicators related to research performance, field
citation density and journal impact. We find a size-dependent cumulative
advantage for the impact of universities in terms of total number of citations.
In previous work a similar scaling rule was found at the level of research
groups. Therefore we conjecture that this scaling rule is a prevalent property
of the science system. We observe that lower performance universities have a
larger size-dependent cumulative advantage for receiving citations than
top-performance universities. We also find that for the lower-performance
universities the fraction of not-cited publications decreases considerably with
size. Generally, the higher the average journal impact of the publications of a
university, the lower the number of not-cited publications. We find that the
average research performance does not dilute with size. Large top-performance
universities succeed in keeping a high performance over a broad range of
activities. This most probably is an indication of their scientific attractive
power. Next we find that particularly for the lower-performance universities
the field citation density provides a strong cumulative advantage in citations
per publication. The relation between number of citations and field citation
density found in this study can be considered as a second basic scaling rule of
the science system. Top-performance universities publish in journals with
significantly higher journal impact as compared to the lower performance
universities. We find a significant decrease of the fraction of self-citations
with increasing research performance, average field citation density, and
average journal impact.

(BSNRs) observed in the radio band is determined mainly either by a non-uniform
interstellar medium (ISM) or by a non-uniform ambient magnetic field.
  METHODS: We perform 3-D MHD simulations of a spherical SNR shock propagating
through a magnetized ISM. Two cases of shock propagation are considered: 1)
through a gradient of ambient density with a uniform ambient magnetic field; 2)
through a homogeneous medium with a gradient of ambient magnetic field
strength. From the simulations, we synthesize the synchrotron radio emission,
making different assumptions about the details of acceleration and injection of
relativistic electrons.
  RESULTS: We find that asymmetric BSNRs are produced if the line-of-sight is
not aligned with the gradient of ambient plasma density or with the gradient of
ambient magnetic field strength. We derive useful parameters to quantify the
degree of asymmetry of the remnants that may provide a powerful diagnostic of
the microphysics of strong shock waves through the comparison between models
and observations.
  CONCLUSIONS: BSNRs with two radio limbs of different brightness can be
explained if a gradient of ambient density or, most likely, of ambient magnetic
field strength is perpendicular to the radio limbs. BSNRs with converging
similar radio arcs can be explained if the gradient runs between the two arcs.

Comments and suggestions are welcome",,,,nlin.CD,,"  Pattern formation and evolution in unsynchronizable complex networks are
investigated. Due to the asymmetric topology, the synchronous patterns formed
in complex networks are irregular and nonstationary. For coupling strength
immediately out of the synchronizable region, the typical phenomenon is the
on-off intermittency of the system dynamics. The patterns appeared in this
process are signatured by the coexistence of a giant cluster, which comprises
most of the nodes, and a few number of small clusters. The pattern evolution is
characterized by the giant cluster irregularly absorbs or emits the small
clusters. As the coupling strength leaves away from the synchronization
bifurcation point, the giant cluster is gradually dissolved into a number of
small clusters, and the system dynamics is characterized by the integration and
separation of the small clusters. Dynamical mechanisms and statistical
properties of the nonstationary pattern evolution are analyzed and conducted,
and some scalings are newly revealed. Remarkably, it is found that the few
active nodes, which escape from the giant cluster with a high frequency, are
independent of the coupling strength while are sensitive to the bifurcation
types. We hope our findings about nonstationary pattern could give additional
understandings to the dynamics of complex systems and have implications to some
real problems where systems maintain their normal functions only in the
unsynchronizable state.

converted the photometry values to fluxes and fit them to a spectral energy
distribution using the spectroscopy to determine which model to use (i.e. pure
hydrogen, pure helium, or metal-rich helium), resulting in estimates of
effective temperature and distance. Eight of the new and 12 known systems are
estimated to be within the NStars and Catalogue of Nearby Stars (CNS) horizons

dwarfs identified in recent years with significant absorption in the infrared

coincide with those of the random-site Ising model. However structural disorder
gives rise to considerable effects for non-asymptotic critical dynamics. We
investigate this phenomenon by a field-theoretical renormalization group
analysis in the two-loop order. We study critical slowing down and obtain
quantitative estimates for the effective and asymptotic critical exponents of
the order parameter and scalar density. The results predict complex scenarios
for the effective critical exponent approaching an asymptotic regime.

  methods: Fractal and recurrence quantification analysis",42 pages including figures,,,,physics.gen-ph,,"  For the first time we apply the methodologies of nonlinear analysis to
investigate atomic matter. We use these methods in the analysis of Atomic
Weights and of Mass Number of atomic nuclei. Using the AutoCorrelation Function
and Mutual Information we establish the presence of nonlinear effects in the
mechanism of increasing mass of atomic nuclei considered as a function of the
atomic number. We find that increasing mass is divergent, possibly chaotic. We
also investigate the possible existence of a Power Law for atomic nuclei and,
using also the technique of the variogram, we conclude that a fractal regime
could superintend to the mechanism of increasing mass for nuclei. Finally,
using the Hurst exponent, evidence is obtained that the mechanism of increasing
mass in atomic nuclei is in the fractional Brownian regime. The most
interesting results are obtained by using Recurrence Quantification Analysis
(RQA). New recurrences, psudoperiodicities, self-resemblance and class of
self-similarities are identified with values of determinism showing oscillating
values indicating the presence of more or less stability during the process of
increasing mass of atomic nuclei. In brief, new regimes of regularities are
identified for atomic nuclei that deserve to be studied by future researches.
In particular an accurate analysis of binding energy values by nonlinear
methods is further required.

of data using power spectra it can be important to use appropriate weighting of
data points to achieve the best sensitivity. It was recently demonstrated that
for Swift BAT data a simple weighting scheme can actually sometimes reduce the
sensitivity of the power spectrum depending on source brightness. Instead, a
modified weighting scheme, based on the Cochran semi-weighted mean, gives
improved results independent of source brightness. We investigate the benefits
of weighting power spectra in period searches using simulated GLAST LAT
observations of gamma-ray binaries.

carried out new multiconfiguration Breit-Pauli (MCBP) calculations using the
AUTOSTRUCTURE code. For electron-ion collision energies < 25 eV we find poor
agreement between our experimental and theoretical resonance energies and
strengths. From 25 to 42 eV we find good agreement between the two for
resonance energies. But in this energy range the theoretical resonance
strengths are ~ 31% larger than the experimental results. This is larger than
our estimated total experimental uncertainty in this energy range of +/- 26%
(at a 90% confidence level). Above 42 eV the difference in the shape between
the calculated and measured 3s3p(^1P_1)nl DR series limit we attribute partly
to the nl dependence of the detection probabilities of high Rydberg states in
the experiment. We have used our measurements, supplemented by our

proposal chain can avoid this problem, keeping the mean computational cost
similar to the cost of the usual Metropolis. More precisely we prove that, with
a suitable variant in the proposal, the Metropolis chain has a spectral gap
which decreases polynomially in 1/N. Using some symmetry structure of the
energy, the method rests on allowing appropriate jumps within the energy level

independent all-sky wavelet analyses, our results suggest that the dip in
extragalactic brightness and number counts and the WMAP cold spot are
physically related, i.e., that the coincidence is neither a statistical anomaly
nor a WMAP foreground correction problem. If the cold spot does originate from
structures at modest redshifts, as we suggest, then there is no remaining need
for non-Gaussian processes at the last scattering surface of the CMB to explain
the cold spot. The late integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, already seen
statistically for NVSS source counts, can now be seen to operate on a single
region. To create the magnitude and angular size of the WMAP cold spot requires
a ~140 Mpc radius completely empty void at z<=1 along this line of sight. This
is far outside the current expectations of the concordance cosmology, and adds
to the anomalies seen in the CMB.

grazing-collisions; and thick J-shaped tails beaded with star formation and
double cores. One type is not common locally and is apparently a loose
assemblage of smaller galaxies. Photometric measurements were made of the tails
and clumps, and physical sizes were determined assuming photometric redshifts.
Antennae tails are a factor of ~3 smaller in GEMS and GOODS systems compared to
local antennae; their disks are a factor of ~2 smaller than locally. Collisions
among early type galaxies generally show no fine structure in their tails,
indicating that stellar debris is usually not unstable. One exception has a
5x10**9 Msun smooth red clump that could be a pure stellar condensation. Most
tidal dwarfs are blue and probably form by gravitational instabilities in the
gas. One tidal dwarf looks like it existed previously and was incorporated into
the arm tip by tidal forces. The star-forming regions in tidal arms are 10 to
1000 times more massive than star complexes in local galaxies, although their
separations are about the same. If they all form by gravitational
instabilities, then the gaseous velocity dispersions in interacting galaxies
have to be larger than in local galaxies by a factor of ~5 or more; the gas
column densities have to be larger by the square of this factor.

Victora has suggested a figure of merit xi = 2 E_b/mu_0 m_s H_sw, the ratio of
the energy barrier to that of a Stoner-Wohlfarth system with the same switching
field, which is 1 for a Stoner-Wohlfarth (coherently switching) particle and 2
for an optimal two-layer composite medium. A number of theoretical approaches
have been used for this problem (e.g., various numbers of coupled
Stoner-Wohlfarth layers and continuum micromagnetics). In this paper we show
that many of these approaches can be regarded as special cases or
approximations to a variational formulation of the problem, in which the energy
is minimized for fixed magnetization. The results can be easily visualized in
terms of a plot of the energy as a function of magnetic moment m_z, in which
both the switching field [the maximum slope of E(m_z)] and the stability
(determined by the energy barrier E_b) are geometrically visible. In this
formulation we can prove a rigorous limit on the figure of merit xi, which can
be no higher than 4. We also show that a quadratic anistropy suggested by Suess

solutions for 3 Solar-type stars: HD 100777, HD 190647, and HD 221287. The
radial-velocity data of HD 100777 is best explained by the presence of a 1.1
M_Jup planetary companion on a 384--day eccentric orbit (e=0.36). The orbital
fit obtained for the slightly evolved star HD 190647 reveals the presence of a
long-period (P=1038 d) 1.9 M_Jup planetary companion on a moderately eccentric
orbit (e=0.18). HD 221287 is hosting a 3.1 M_Jup planet on a 456--day orbit.
The shape of this orbit is not very well constrained because of our non-optimal
temporal coverage and because of the presence of abnormally large residuals. We
find clues for these large residuals to result from spectral line profile
variations probably induced by stellar activity related processes.

in the cone of positive definite covariance matrices. We study these varieties
in the case of Bayesian networks, with a view towards generalizing the
recursive factorization theorem to situations with hidden variables. In the
case when the underlying graph is a tree, we show that the vanishing ideal of
the model is generated by the conditional independence statements implied by
graph. We also show that the ideal of any Bayesian network is homogeneous with
respect to a multigrading induced by a collection of upstream random variables.
This has a number of important consequences for hidden variable models.
Finally, we relate the ideals of Bayesian networks to a number of classical
constructions in algebraic geometry including toric degenerations of the
Grassmannian, matrix Schubert varieties, and secant varieties.

conductors tend to infinity, the behavior of normalized zeros near the central
point of families of L-functions agree with the N -> oo scaling limits of
eigenvalues near 1 of subgroups of U(N). Evidence for this has been found for
many families by studying the n-level densities; for suitably restricted test
functions the main terms agree with random matrix theory. In particular, all
one-parameter families of elliptic curves with rank r over Q(T) and the same
distribution of signs of functional equations have the same limiting behavior.
We break this universality and find family dependent lower order correction
terms in many cases; these lower order terms have applications ranging from
excess rank to modeling the behavior of zeros near the central point, and
depend on the arithmetic of the family. We derive an alternate form of the
explicit formula for GL(2) L-functions which simplifies comparisons, replacing
sums over powers of Satake parameters by sums of the moments of the Fourier
coefficients lambda_f(p). Our formula highlights the differences that we expect
to exist from families whose Fourier coefficients obey different laws (for
example, we expect Sato-Tate to hold only for non-CM families of elliptic
curves). Further, by the work of Rosen and Silverman we expect lower order
biases to the Fourier coefficients in families of elliptic curves with rank
over Q(T); these biases can be seen in our expansions. We analyze several
families of elliptic curves and see different lower order corrections,
depending on whether or not the family has complex multiplication, a forced
torsion point, or non-zero rank over Q(T).

provide a way to break the universality of behavior. The L-functions Ratios

test a specific case here, that of the 1-level density for the symplectic

all the lower order terms up to size O(X^{-1/2+epsilon}) and observe perfect

a second modulus which is automatically stabilized and acts as a source of cold

quintessence field (hence realizing VAMP models within a String context).
However, any attempt to saturate the present cold dark matter component in this
manner leads to unacceptable deviations from cosmological data -- a numerical
study reveals that this source can account for up to about 7% of the total cold
dark matter budget. We also show that (1) the model will support a de Sitter

supersymmetry in the compact space; (2) variations in the fine structure

of disky galaxies smoothly decreases with increasing luminosity. The large
sample allows us to describe these trends accurately with tight linear
relations that are statistically robust against the uncertainty in the
isophotal shape measurements. There is also a host of significant correlations
between the disky fraction and indicators of nuclear activity (both in the
optical and in the radio) and environment (soft X-rays, group mass, group
hierarchy). Our analysis shows however that these correlations can be
accurately matched by assuming that the disky fraction depends only on galaxy
luminosity or mass. We therefore conclude that neither the level of activity,
nor group mass or group hierarchy help in better predicting the isophotal shape
of early-type galaxies.

N-body simulation, we investigate the origin of the dichotomy among early-type
galaxies. We find that boxy galaxies originate from mergers with a progenitor
mass ratio $n < 2$ and with a combined cold gas mass fraction $F_{\rm cold} <
0.1$. Our model accurately reproduces the observed fraction of boxy systems as
a function of luminosity and halo mass, for both central galaxies and
satellites. After correcting for the stellar mass dependence, the properties of
the last major merger of early-type galaxies are independent of their halo
mass. This provides theoretical support for the conjecture of Pasquali et al
(2007) that the stellar mass of an early-type galaxy is the main parameter that
governs its isophotal shape. We argue that the observed dichotomy of early-type
galaxies has a natural explanation within hierarchical structure formation, and
does not require AGN feedback. Rather, we argue that it owes to the fact that
more massive systems (i) have more massive progenitors, (ii) assemble later,
and (iii) have a larger fraction of early-type progenitors. Each of these three
trends causes the cold gas mass fraction of the progenitors of more massive
early-types to be lower, so that their last major merger was dryer. Finally,
our model predicts that (i) less than 10 percent of all early-type galaxies
form in major mergers that involve two early-type progenitors, (ii) more than
95 percent of all boxy early-type galaxies with $M_* < 2 \times 10^{10} h^{-1}
\Msun$ are satellite galaxies, and (iii) about 70 percent of all low mass
early-types do not form a supermassive black hole binary at their last major
merger. The latter may help to explain why low mass early-types have central
cusps, while their massive counterparts have cores.

sharing isosceles triangles with exchange constants $J$ on two bonds and $J'$
on the third bond. We study the properties of such spin systems, and show that
despite the distortion, the lattice retains a great deal of frustration.
Although sub-extensive, the classical ground state degeneracy remains very
large, growing exponentially with the system perimeter. We consider degeneracy
lifting by thermal and quantum fluctuations. To linear (spin wave) order, the
degeneracy is found to stay intact. Two complementary approaches are therefore
introduced, appropriate to low and high temperatures, which point to the same
ordered pattern. In the low temperature limit, an effective chirality
Hamiltonian is derived from non-linear spin waves which predicts a transition
on increasing $J'/J$, from $\sqrt 3\times \sqrt 3$ type order to a new
ferrimagnetic {\em striped chirality} order with a doubled unit cell. This is
confirmed by a large-N approximation on the O($n$) model on this lattice. While
the saddle point solution produces a line degeneracy, $O(1/n)$ corrections
select the non-trivial wavevector of the striped chirality state. The quantum
limit of spin 1/2 on this lattice is studied via exact small system
diagonalization and compare well with experimental results at intermediate
temperatures. We suggest that the very low temperature spin frozen state seen
in NMR experiments may be related to the disconnected nature of classical
ground states on this lattice, which leads to a prediction for NMR line shapes.

were bright enough to enable a spectral analysis using standard power-law
models. The sample consists of 18 flat-spectrum radio quasars(FSRQs), 6
low-frequency peaked BL Lac objects (LBLs) and 2 high-frequency peaked BL Lac
objects (HBLs). We do not detect any clear pattern in the variation of spectral
index with flux. Some of the blazars do not show any statistical evidence for
spectral variability. The spectrum hardens with increasing flux in a few cases.
There is also evidence for a flux-hardness anticorrelation at low fluxes in
five blazars. The well-observed blazars (3C 279, 3C 273, PKS 0528+134, PKS
1622-297 PKS 0208-512) do not show any overall trend in the long-term spectral
dependence on flux, but the sample shows a mixture of hard and soft states. We
observed a previously unreported spectral hysteresis at weekly timescales in
all three FSRQs for which data from flares lasting for ~(3-4) weeks were
available. All three sources show a counterclockwise rotation, despite the
widely different flux profiles. We analyze the observed spectral behavior in
the context of various inverse Compton mechanisms believed to be responsible
for emission in the EGRET energy range. Our analysis uses the EGRET skymaps

recover robust star formation and metallicity histories from galactic spectra.
VESPA uses the full spectral range to construct a galaxy history from synthetic

reliable star formation histories on a galaxy-by-galaxy basis. Our goal is
robustness as opposed to high resolution histories, and the method is designed
to return high time resolution only where the data demand it. In this paper we
detail the method and we present our findings when we apply VESPA to synthetic
and real Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectroscopic data. We show that the
number of parameters that can be recovered from a spectrum depends strongly on
the signal-to-noise, wavelength coverage and presence or absence of a young
population. For a typical SDSS sample of galaxies, we can normally recover
between 2 to 5 stellar populations. We find very good agreement between VESPA
and our previous analysis of the SDSS sample with MOPED.

efficiently generate realizations of halo distributions and ionization maps at
high redshifts. Our procedure combines an excursion-set approach with
first-order Lagrangian perturbation theory and operates directly on the linear
density and velocity fields. As such, the achievable dynamic range with our
algorithm surpasses the current practical limit of N-body codes by orders of
magnitude. This is particularly significant in studies of reionization, where
the dynamic range is the principal limiting factor. We test our halo-finding
and HII bubble-finding algorithms independently against N-body simulations with
radiative transfer and obtain excellent agreement. We compute the size
distributions of ionized and neutral regions in our maps. We find even larger
ionized bubbles than do purely analytic models at the same volume-weighted mean
hydrogen neutral fraction. We also generate maps and power spectra of 21-cm
brightness temperature fluctuations, which for the first time include
corrections due to gas bulk velocities. We find that velocities widen the tails
of the temperature distributions and increase small-scale power, though these
effects quickly diminish as reionization progresses. We also include some
preliminary results from a simulation run with the largest dynamic range to
date: a 250 Mpc box that resolves halos with masses M >~ 2.2 x10^8 M_sun. We
show that accurately modeling the late stages of reionization requires such
large scales. The speed and dynamic range provided by our semi-numerical
approach will be extremely useful in the modeling of early structure formation
and reionization.

Seyfert 2 galaxy M51 suggest the presence of a dense circumnuclear rotating
disk, which may be the reservoir for fueling the active nucleus and obscures it
from direct view in the optical. However, our recent interferometric CO(3-2)
observations show a hint of a velocity gradient perpendicular to the rotating
disk, which suggests a more complex structure than previously thought. To image
the putative circumnuclear molecular gas disk at sub-arcsecond resolution to
better understand both the spatial distribution and kinematics of the molecular
gas. We carried out CO(2-1) and CO(1-0) line observations of the nuclear region
of M51 with the new A configuration of the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer,
yielding a spatial resolution lower than 15 pc. The high resolution images show
no clear evidence of a disk, aligned nearly east-west and perpendicular to the
radio jet axis, as suggested by previous observations, but show two separate
features located on the eastern and western sides of the nucleus. The western
feature shows an elongated structure along the jet and a good velocity
correspondence with optical emission lines associated with the jet, suggesting
that this feature is a jet-entrained gas. The eastern feature is elongated
nearly east-west ending around the nucleus. A velocity gradient appears in the
same direction with increasingly blueshifted velocities near the nucleus. This
velocity gradient is in the opposite sense of that previously inferred for the
putative circumnuclear disk. Possible explanations for the observed molecular
gas distribution and kinematics are that a rotating gas disk disturbed by the
jet, gas streaming toward the nucleus, or a ring with another smaller counter-
or Keplarian-rotating gas disk inside.

detect the absorption spectrum of a secondary star of spectral type K3 +- 1

BF Eri has a large proper motion (100 mas/yr), and we have a preliminary
parallax measurement that confirms the large proper motion and yields only an
upper limit for the parallax. BF Eri's space velocity is evidently large, and
it appears to belong to the halo population. In CZ Aql, the emission lines have
strong wings that move with large velocity amplitude, suggesting a
magnetically-channeled accretion flow. The orbital period of V1006 Cyg places
it squarely within the 2- to 3-hour ""gap"" in the distribution of cataclysmic

power-law exponent \eta=2, we find interesting universal features displayed by
the prefactor \upsilon=\upsilon_o/3, if l is odd, and \upsilon=\upsilon_e/3,
otherwise. Although \upsilon_o and \upsilon_e are nonuniversal (disorder
dependent) and distinct in magnitude, the combination \upsilon_o + \upsilon_e =
-1/4 is universal if C is computed along the symmetric (longitudinal) axis. The
origin of the nonuniversalities of the prefactors is discussed in the
renormalization-group framework where a solvable toy model is considered.
Moreover, we relate the average correlation function with the average
entanglement entropy, whose amplitude has been recently shown to be universal.
The nonuniversalities of the prefactors are shown to contribute only to surface
terms of the entropy. Finally, we discuss the experimental relevance of our
results by computing the structure factor whose scaling properties,
interestingly, depend on the correlation prefactors.

  Galaxy Clusters","49 pages, 9 figures, accepted by ApJ","Astrophys.J.664:181-197,2007",10.1086/518766,,astro-ph,,"  We study the infrared (IR) properties of galaxies in the cluster MS 1054-03
at z=0.83 by combining MIPS 24 micron data with spectra of more than 400
galaxies and a very deep K-band selected catalog. 19 IR cluster members are
selected spectroscopically, and an additional 15 are selected by their
photometric redshifts. We derive the IR luminosity function of the cluster and
find strong evolution compared to the similar-mass Coma cluster. The best
fitting Schechter function gives L*_{IR}=11.49 +0.30/-0.29 L_sun with a fixed
faint end slope, about one order of magnitude larger than that in Coma. The
rate of evolution of the IR luminosity from Coma to MS 1054-03 is consistent
with that found in field galaxies, and it suggests that some internal
mechanism, e.g., the consumption of the gas fuel, is responsible for the
general decline of the cosmic star formation rate (SFR) in different
environments. The mass-normalized integrated SFR within 0.5R_200 in MS 1054-03
also shows evolution compared with other rich clusters at lower redshifts, but
the trend is less conclusive if the mass selection effect is considered. A
nonnegligible fraction (13%) of cluster members, are forming stars actively and
the overdensity of IR galaxies is about 20 compared to the field. It is
unlikely that clusters only passively accrete star forming galaxies from the
surrounding fields and have their star formation quenched quickly afterward;
instead, many cluster galaxies still have large amounts of gas, and their star
formation may be enhanced by the interaction with the cluster.

  Consensus",Submitted to IEEE Transactions,,10.1109/TSP.2008.920143,,cs.IT cs.LG math.IT,,"  In a sensor network, in practice, the communication among sensors is subject
to:(1) errors or failures at random times; (3) costs; and(2) constraints since
sensors and networks operate under scarce resources, such as power, data rate,
or communication. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is usually a main factor in
determining the probability of error (or of communication failure) in a link.
These probabilities are then a proxy for the SNR under which the links operate.
The paper studies the problem of designing the topology, i.e., assigning the
probabilities of reliable communication among sensors (or of link failures) to
maximize the rate of convergence of average consensus, when the link
communication costs are taken into account, and there is an overall
communication budget constraint. To consider this problem, we address a number
of preliminary issues: (1) model the network as a random topology; (2)
establish necessary and sufficient conditions for mean square sense (mss) and
almost sure (a.s.) convergence of average consensus when network links fail;
and, in particular, (3) show that a necessary and sufficient condition for both
mss and a.s. convergence is for the algebraic connectivity of the mean graph
describing the network topology to be strictly positive. With these results, we
formulate topology design, subject to random link failures and to a
communication cost constraint, as a constrained convex optimization problem to
which we apply semidefinite programming techniques. We show by an extensive
numerical study that the optimal design improves significantly the convergence
speed of the consensus algorithm and can achieve the asymptotic performance of
a non-random network at a fraction of the communication cost.

characterize drifts for which the family of laws of the vector of spacings is

gets a constant upward drift, and prove that independent and identically

November 2005. The BAT monitored it recurrently for a total of 2.7 Ms, and the
XRT and UVOT pointed it on seven occasions for a total of 67 ks, making it one
of the AGNs best monitored by Swift. The automatic optical and infrared
telescope REM has monitored simultaneously the source at all times. In
January-February 2005 PKS0537-441 has been detected at its brightest in optical
and X-rays: more than a factor of 2 brighter in X-rays and about a factor 60
brighter in the optical than observed in December 2004. The July 2005
observation recorded a fainter X-ray state. The simultaneous optical state,
monitored by both Swift UVOT and REM, is high, and in the VRI bands it is
comparable to what was recorded in early January 2005, before the outburst. In
November 2005, the source subsided both in X-rays and optical to a quiescent
state, having decreased by factors of ~4 and ~60 with respect to the
January-February 2005 outburst, respectively. Our monitoring shows an overall
well correlated optical and X-ray decay. On the shorter time scales (days or
hours), there is no obvious correlation between X-ray and optical variations,
but the former tend to be more pronounced, opposite to what is observed on
monthly time scales. The widely different amplitude of the long term
variability in optical and X-rays is very unusual and makes this observation a
unique case study for blazar activity. The spectral energy distributions are
interpreted in terms of the synchrotron and inverse Compton mechanisms within a
jet where the plasma radiates via internal shocks and the dissipation depends
on the distance of the emitting region from the central engine (abridged).

consisting of a nanomechanical resonator (NMR), a superconducting Cooper-pair
box (CPB) and a superconducting transmission line resonator (STLR). The
nonlinear interaction between the NMR and the STLR can be implemented by
setting the external biased flux of the CPB at certain values. The interaction
Hamiltonian between the NMR and the STLR is derived by performing Fr$\rm\ddot
o$hlich transformation on the total Hamiltonian of the combined system. Just by
adiabatically keeping the CPB at the ground state, we get the standard
parametric down-conversion Hamiltonian. The CPB plays the role of ``nonlinear
media"", and the squeezed states of the NMR can be easily generated in a manner
similar to the three-wave mixing in quantum optics. This is the three-wave
mixing in a solid-state circuit.

observation the suspicion arose that the object might be an asynchronous polar
(Tovmassian et al. 2004). The disparity between the presumed orbital and spin

of the object to resolve the problem. Methods: New simultaneous spectroscopic
and photometric observations spanning several years allowed measurements of
radial velocities of emission and absorption lines from the secondary star and
brightness variations due to synchrotron emission from the primary. Results:
New observations show that the object is actually synchronous and its orbital
and spin period are equal to 4.04 hours. Conclusions: We identify the source of
confusion of previous observations to be a high velocity component of emission
line arousing from the stream of matter leaving L1 point.

more seriously than was previously assumed. A reexamination of the relevant
calculations by Einstein shows that, indeed, at least some of them most likely
date from early October 1915. But in support of earlier historical
interpretation of Einstein's notes, it is argued that the appearance of Nova
Geminorum 1912 (DN Gem) in March 1912 may, in fact, provide a relevant context
and motivation for Einstein's lensing calculations on the occasion of his first
meeting with Erwin Freundlich during a visit in Berlin in April 1912. We also
comment on the significance of Einstein's consideration of gravitational

entangling rate is shown to be upper bounded by c*log(d)*norm(H), where d is
the smallest dimension of the interacting particles, norm(H) is the operator
norm of H, and c is a constant close to 1. Under certain restrictions on the
initial state we prove analogous upper bound for the ancilla-assisted
entangling rate with a constant c that does not depend upon dimensions of local
ancillas. The restriction is that the initial state has at most two distinct
Schmidt coefficients (each coefficient may have arbitrarily large
multiplicity). Our proof is based on analysis of a mixing rate -- a functional
measuring how fast entropy can be produced if one mixes a time-independent
state with a state evolving unitarily.

increase channel capacity and has a great potential to improve network capacity
for mesh networks. In a MIMO-based mesh network, the links outgoing from each
node sharing the common communication spectrum can be modeled as a Gaussian
vector broadcast channel. Recently, researchers showed that ``dirty paper
coding'' (DPC) is the optimal transmission strategy for Gaussian vector
broadcast channels. So far, there has been little study on how this fundamental
result will impact the cross-layer design for MIMO-based mesh networks. To fill
this gap, we consider the problem of jointly optimizing DPC power allocation in
the link layer at each node and multihop/multipath routing in a MIMO-based mesh
networks. It turns out that this optimization problem is a very challenging
non-convex problem. To address this difficulty, we transform the original
problem to an equivalent problem by exploiting the channel duality. For the
transformed problem, we develop an efficient solution procedure that integrates
Lagrangian dual decomposition method, conjugate gradient projection method
based on matrix differential calculus, cutting-plane method, and subgradient
method. In our numerical example, it is shown that we can achieve a network
performance gain of 34.4% by using DPC.

planetary lensing follow-up observations, we investigate the variation of the
probability of detecting planetary signals depending on the observables of the
lensing magnification and source brightness. In estimating the probability, we
consider variation of the photometric precision by using a quantity defined as
the ratio of the fractional deviation of the planetary perturbation to the
photometric precision. From this investigation, we find consistent result from
previous studies that the probability increases with the increase of the
magnification. The increase rate is boosted at a certain magnification at which
perturbations caused by central caustic begin to occur. We find this boost
occurs at moderate magnifications of $A\lesssim 20$, implying that probability
can be high even for events with moderate magnifications. The probability
increases as the source brightness increases. We find that the probability of
events associated with stars brighter than clump giants is not negligible even
at magnifications as low as $A\sim 5$. In the absence of rare the prime target
of very high-magnification events, we, therefore, recommend to observe events
with brightest source stars and highest magnifications among the alerted
events. Due to the increase of the source size with the increase of the
brightness, however, the probability rapidly drops off beyond a certain
magnification, causing detections of low mass ratio planets ($q\lesssim
10^{-4}$) difficult from the observations of events involved with giant stars
with magnifications $A\gtrsim 70$.

  Astrophysics & Space Science. v3 corrects bibliography","Astrophys.Space Sci.311:35-45,2007",10.1007/s10509-007-9575-8,,astro-ph,,"  Magnetic fields likely play a key role in the dynamics and evolution of
protoplanetary discs. They have the potential to efficiently transport angular
momentum by MHD turbulence or via the magnetocentrifugal acceleration of
outflows from the disk surface, and magnetically-driven mixing has implications
for disk chemistry and evolution of the grain population. However, the weak
ionisation of protoplanetary discs means that magnetic fields may not be able
to effectively couple to the matter. I present calculations of the ionisation
equilibrium and magnetic diffusivity as a function of height from the disk
midplane at radii of 1 and 5 AU. Dust grains tend to suppress magnetic coupling
by soaking up electrons and ions from the gas phase and reducing the
conductivity of the gas by many orders of magnitude. However, once grains have
grown to a few microns in size their effect starts to wane and magnetic fields
can begin to couple to the gas even at the disk midplane. Because ions are
generally decoupled from the magnetic field by neutral collisions while
electrons are not, the Hall effect tends to dominate the diffusion of the
magnetic field when it is able to partially couple to the gas.
  For a standard population of 0.1 micron grains the active surface layers have
a combined column of about 2 g/cm^2 at 1 AU; by the time grains have aggregated
to 3 microns the active surface density is 80 g/cm^2. In the absence of grains,
x-rays maintain magnetic coupling to 10% of the disk material at 1 AU (150
g/cm^2). At 5 AU the entire disk thickness becomes active once grains have
aggregated to 1 micron in size.

CP-conjugate processes. We show that both the $D^0$-$\bar{D}^0$ mixing
parameters ($x$ and $y$) and the strong phase difference between $\bar{D}^0\to
K^{*\pm}K^\mp$ and $D^0\to K^{*\pm}K^\mp$ transitions ($\delta$) can be
determined or constrained from the time-dependent measurements of these decay
modes. On the $\psi (3770)$ and $\psi (4140)$ resonances at a $\tau$-charm
factory, it is even possible to determine or constrain $x$, $y$ and $\delta$
from the time-independent measurements of coherent $(D^0\bar{D}^0) \to
(K^{*\pm} K^\mp)(K^{*\pm} K^\mp)$ decays. If the CP-violating phase of
$D^0$-$\bar{D}^0$ mixing is significant in a scenario beyond the standard
model, it can also be extracted from the $K^{*\pm} K^\mp$ events.

shows significant variability from the best fit constant spin-down rate of
$\dot P = 7.5112(6) \times 10^{-13}$ s s$^{-1}$, suggesting strong timing noise

the spectrum of cosmic rays at $\sim 10^{19}$ eV. A scenario interprets the
ankle as the transition from Galactic to extragalactic cosmic rays ({\it
ankle-transition scenario}), while the other is that the dip caused by pair
production on the cosmic microwave background radiation ({\it proton-dip
scenario}). In this paper, we consider whether cosmogenic neutrinos can be a
clue to judge which scenario is favored. We calculated the fluxes of cosmogenic
neutrinos following these scenarios with plausible physical parameter sets, and
found several important features as follows. First of all, the neutrino flux at
$\sim 10^{20}$ eV becomes much higher in the ankle-transition scenario as long
as the maximum energy of the cosmic rays at sources is sufficiently high. On
the other hand, the neutrino spectrum has a characteristic peak at $\sim
10^{16}$ eV in the proton-dip scenario on the condition that extragalactic
protons significantly contribute to the observed cosmic rays down to $10^{17}$
eV. Thus, we conclude cosmogenic neutrinos should give us a clue to judge which
scenario is favored, unless these features are masked by the neutrino
background coming from possible, powerful neutrino sources such as AGNs and
GRBs. We also found an interesting feature that the neutrino flux at $\sim
10^{18}$ eV depends only on the cosmological evolution of the cosmic ray
sources. That means cosmogenic neutrinos with the energy bring us information
on the cosmological evolution of the sources of ultra-high energy cosmic rays.
Finally, we compare the fluxes of cosmogenic neutrinos with the expected
sensitivity curves of several neutrino detectors, and conclude the detection of
cosmogenic neutrinos in the near future is promising.

the daemon approach is analyzed considering the positive model independent
result of the DAMA/NaI experiment. We explain the maximum in DAMA signals
observed in the May-June period to be associated with the formation behind the
Sun of a trail of daemons that the Sun captures into elongated orbits as it
moves to the apex. The range of significant 2-6-keV DAMA signals fits well the
iodine nuclei elastically knocked out of the NaI(Tl) scintillator by particles
falling on the Earth with V=30-50 km/s from strongly elongated heliocentric
orbits. The half-year periodicity of the slower daemons observed in SPb
originates from the transfer of particles that are deflected through ~90 deg
into near-Earth orbits each time the particles cross the outer reaches of the
Sun which had captured them. Their multi-loop (cross-like) trajectories
traverse many times the Earth's orbit in March and September, which increases
the probability for the particles to enter near-Earth orbits during this time.
Corroboration of celestial mechanics calculations with observations yields
~1e-19 cm2 for the cross section of daemon interaction with the solar matter.

on the Fayet-Iliopoulos breaking, and this is also a crucial ingredient,
together with having three Higgs families, to obtain in these models an
interesting pattern of fermion masses and mixing angles at the renormalizable
lebel. Namely, after the gauge breaking some physical particles appear combined

way. On the other hand, dangerous flavour-changing neutral currents may appear

The cometary morphology of the previously-known UCHII region G192.584-0.041 is
clearly revealed in our sensitive, multi-configuration 3.6cm images. The 1.3mm
continuum emission has been resolved into three compact cores, all of which are
dominated by dust emission and have radii < 7000AU. The mass estimates for
these cores range from 6 to 35 Msun. The centroid of the brightest dust core
(SMA1) is offset by 1.1'' (2800 AU) from the peak of the cometary UCHII region
and exhibits the strongest HC3N, CN, and DCN line emission in the region. SMA1
also exhibits compact CH3OH, SiO, and H2CO emission and likely contains a young
hot core. We find spatial and kinematic evidence that SMA1 may contain further
multiplicity, with one of the components coincident with a newly-detected H2O
maser. There are no mid-infrared point source counterparts to any of the dust
cores, further suggesting an early evolutionary phase for these objects. The
dominant mid-infrared emission is a diffuse, broadband component that traces
the surface of the cometary UCHII region but is obscured by foreground material
on its southern edge. An additional 4.5 micron linear feature emanating to the
northeast of SMA1 is aligned with a cluster of methanol masers and likely
traces a outflow from a protostar within SMA1. Our observations provide direct
evidence that S255N is forming a cluster of intermediate to high-mass stars.

galaxies with the nominal flux limit S=3.0 10^{-12}erg/s/cm2 for the ROSAT
energy band (0.1-2.4)keV. Several tests are performed showing no significant
incompletenesses of the REFLEX clusters with X-ray luminosities brighter than
10^{43}erg/s up to scales of about 800 Mpc/h. They also indicate that cosmic
variance might be more important than previous studies suggest. We regard this
as a warning not to draw general cosmological conclusions from cluster samples
with a size smaller than REFLEX. Power spectra, P(k), of comoving cluster
number densities are estimated for flux- and volume-limited subsamples. The
most important result is the detection of a broad maximum within the comoving
wavenumber range 0.022<k<0.030 h/Mpc. The data suggest an increase of the power
spectral amplitude with X-ray luminosity. Compared to optically selected
cluster samples the REFLEX P(k)is flatter for wavenumbers k<0.05 h/Mpc thus
shifting the maximum of P(k) to larger scales. The smooth maximum is not
consistent with the narrow peak detected at k=0.05 h/Mpc using the Abell/ACO
richness $\ge 0$ data. In the range 0.02<k<0.4 h/Mpc general agreement is found
between the slope of the REFLEX P(k) and those obtained with optically selected
galaxies. A semi-analytic description of the biased nonlinear power spectrum in
redshift space gives the best agreement for low-density Cold Dark Matter models
with or without a cosmological constant.

BeppoSAX Wide Field Cameras (WFC) during the burst to the X-ray afterglow
detected by the BeppoSAX Narrow Field Instruments. A single power-law model for
the afterglow, f(t) ~ t^{-1.42}, is ruled out. Provided the initial time of the
afterglow is assumed to coincide with the last short pulse in the X-ray prompt
event (i.e., 72 seconds after the GRB trigger time), the X-ray emission from
\~80 to 10^5 seconds after the GRB trigger is well described by an external
shock expanding in a decelerating jet, in which synchrotron radiation takes
place. This model, represented by a double power-law of indices alpha_1 ~ 1 and
alpha_2 ~ 2 before and after a jet collimation break time of ~0.5 days after
GRB, respectively, is consistent with the second and third upper limits
measured by the WFC, but not with the first. This may be related to
inhomogeneities in the circumburst medium. Our finding indicates that the
temporal behavior of the GRB990510 X-ray afterglow is similar to that at
optical wavelengths, and thus strengthens the interpretation of the
multiwavelength afterglow as synchrotron emission in a jet with decreasing
Lorentz factor. GRB990510 is thus the only burst in which evidence of a
spreading jet has been found in X-rays.

platform heterogeneity, allowing a very efficient use of the computational

is much slower as it occurs via two-body collisional relaxation.

edges associated with iron, silicon, magnesium, and tentatively sulphur. The
column densities assuming solar abundances are consistent with ~ few x $10^{22}
cm^{-2}$ in excess of the Galactic value, and may point to surrounding cold
material associated with GRS 1915+105. Neutral Fe K$\alpha$ emission, and
ionized absorption from Fe XXV and Fe XXVI are resolved. We limit our
discussion to the Chandra results.

strongly helical flows is discussed in terms of the inverse cascade of magnetic
helicity and the alpha-effect. In simulations of such flows the maximum field
strength exceeds the equipartition field strength for large scale separation.
However, helicity conservation controls the speed at which this final state is
reached. In the presence of open boundaries magnetic helicity fluxes out of the
domain are possible. This reduces the timescales of the field growth, but it
also tends to reduce the maximum attainable field strength.

an approximate phase space distribution function written in terms of the Kepler

those of the double nucleus of M31. The properties of our models are primarily
determined by the behavior of the periodic orbits. Self-gravity in the disk
causes these orbits to assume a characteristic radial eccentricity profile,

  Low-Mass X-Ray Binaries","18 pages with 6 figures. Extended to include more details of
  calculations. To Appear in ApJ",,,,astro-ph,,"  An accretion disk around a rotating magnetized star is subjected to magnetic
torques which induce disk warping and precession. These torques arise from
interactions between the stellar field and the induced surface currents on the
disk. Applying these new effects to weakly magnetized ($B\sim 10^7-10^9$G)
neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries, we study the global hydrodynamical
warping/precession modes of the disk under the combined influences of
relativistic frame dragging, classical precession due to the oblateness of the
neutron star, and the magnetic torques. Under quite general conditions, the
magnetic warping torque can overcome the ``Bardeen-Petterson'' viscous damping
and makes the modes grow. The modes are confined to the inner region of the
disk, and have frequencies close to the sum of the Lense-Thirring frequency,
the classical precession frequency, and the magnetically driven precession
frequency evaluated at the inner disk radius $r_{in}$. As $\dot M$ increases,
the mode frequency is reduced relative to the total precession frequency at
$r_{in}$ since the mode is less concentrated around $r_{in}$ due to the
increasing viscous stress associated with the large $\dot M$. Because of this,
and because the magnetically driven precession is retrograde and depends
strongly on $\dot M$, the mode frequency can have a non-monotonic dependence on
$\dot M$. This may account for several observed features of low-frequency
(10--60 Hz) quasi-periodic oscillations (LFQPOs) in low-mass X-ray binaries
which are otherwise difficult to explain, such as the flattening/turnover in
the LFQPO frequency--$\dot M$ correlation or in the LFQPO frequency--kHz QPO
frequency correlation (e.g., as seen clearly in GX 17+2).

negligible cost in increased error bars. We also test numerically the widely

bremsstrahlung in nucleon-nucleon collisions in the core. We emphasize recent
theoretical achievements, for instance, band structure effects in neutrino
emission due to scattering of electrons in Coulomb crystals of atomic nuclei.
We consider the standard composition of matter (neutrons, protons, electrons,
muons, hyperons) in the core, and also the case of exotic constituents such as
the pion or kaon condensates and quark matter. We discuss the reduction of the
neutrino emissivities by nucleon superfluidity, as well as the specific
neutrino emission produced by Cooper pairing of the superfluid particles. We
also analyze the effects of strong magnetic fields on some reactions, such as
the direct Urca process and the neutrino synchrotron emission of electrons. The
results are presented in the form convenient for practical use. We illustrate
the effects of various neutrino reactions on the cooling of neutron stars. In
particular, the neutrino emission in the crust is critical in setting the
initial thermal relaxation between the core and the crust. Finally, we discuss
the prospects of exploring the properties of supernuclear matter by confronting
cooling simulations with observations of the thermal radiation from isolated
neutron stars.

low-luminosity AGN or do they exist in radio-quiet AGN? A recent detection of
superluminal motion in a supposedly radio-quiet Seyfert raises the question
whether beaming can play an important role in some of these objects as well.
Moreover, VLBI observations of nearby low-luminosity AGN reveal compact
flat-spectrum radio cores very similar to those in bright radio-loud blazars.
Furthermore, with the detection of X-ray emission from the least luminous AGN
we can study, Sgr A* in the Galactic Center, this source now seems to be
dominated entirely by non-thermal emission -- like in BL Lacs. The same may be
true for some X-ray binaries in the Low/Hard-state. Inclusion of low-power
radio jets into the overall picture of AGN provides some clues for what type of
accretion is important, what the power, radiative efficiency and matter-content
of jets is, and what mechanism could be responsible for making jets radio-loud.
We specifically discuss whether proton-proton collisions in a hot accretion

sequence we find objects whose jet power can rival the power extracted by
accretion, while at the low power end of the sequence we find TeV and TeV
candidate blazars, whose spectral properties can give information on the
particle acceleration mechanism and can help to measure the IR background. Most
of the emission of blazars is produced at a distance of few hundreds
Schwarzschild radii from the center, and must be a small fraction of the
kinetic power carried by the jet itself: most of the jet energy must be
transported outwards, to power the extended radio structures. The radiation
produced by jets can be the result of internal shocks between shells of plasma
with different bulk Lorentz factors. This mechanism, thought to be at the
origin of the gamma-rays observed in gamma-ray bursts, can work even better in
blazars, explaining the observed main characteristics of these objects. Chandra
very recently discovered large scale X-ray jets both in blazars and in
radio-galaxies, which can be explained by enhanced Compton emission with
respect to a pure synchrotron self Compton model. In fact, besides the local
synchrotron emission, the radiation coming from the sub-pc jet core and the
cosmic background radiation can provide seed photons for the scattering
process, enahancing the large scale jet X-ray emission in radio-galaxies and
blazars, respectively.

Chandra LETG spectrum reveals it to be broad and smooth, rather than resolved
into individual emission lines. This excess may represent either a primary or
reprocessed continuum component or a blend of broad lines from an ionized
accretion disk. The occurrence of a similar feature in five other NLSy1s leads
us to conclude that this soft X-ray component may be a characteristic of
sources accreting at a very high rate. The X-ray spectrum shows no evidence for
absorption lines, indicating that if gas exists in the line-of-sight then it is
in a very high ionization-state or has an extremely broad velocity
distribution. The new ASCA data confirm that the narrow component of the Fe

  ""Galaxies and their constituents at the highest angular resolutions""",,,,astro-ph,,"  The archetypical, nearby (z=0.37) quasar 3C 48 is an unusual CSS radio source
with excess far-IR emission, whose one-sided radio jet is aligned with the
extended ionized emission and a putative second nucleus. Because of its high
AGN luminosity and proximity, 3C 48 is a good candidate to search for kinematic
signatures of the radio jet-gas coupling and/or of a recent interaction. The
radio morphology and our ground-based integral field spectroscopy suggest that
the jet is interacting with its immediate environment. Using STIS aboard HST in
several slit positions within the central 1"", we map the kinematics and
physical conditions of the extended emission line gas and their relations to
near-nuclear star forming regions found in existing HST images.

that it is significantly stronger for smaller sources, with the strength of the
relationship being similar for both radio galaxies and quasars. In addition to
Doppler effects, there appears to be intrinsic differences between the lobes on

estimated on the basis of the assumption that the dynamics of the broad
emission line gas are dominated by the gravity of the black hole. The most
commonly-employed method is to estimate a characteristic size-scale $r_*$ from
reverberation mapping experiments and combine it with a characteristic velocity
$v_*$ taken from the line profiles; the inferred mass is then estimated by $r_*
v_*^2/G$. We critically discuss the evidence supporting the assumption of
gravitational dynamics and find that the arguments are still inconclusive. We
then explore the range of possible systematic error if the assumption of
gravitational dynamics is granted. Inclination relative to a flattened system
may cause a systematic underestimate of the central mass by a factor $\sim
(h/r)^2$, where $h/r$ is the aspect ratio of the flattening. The coupled
effects of a broad radial emissivity distribution, an unknown angular radiation
pattern of line emission, and sub-optimal sampling in the reverberation
experiment can cause additional systematic errors as large as a factor of 3 or
more in either direction.

proto-neutron star, to its old age as a cold, catalyzed configuration, are
described. A proto-neutron star is formed in the aftermath of a successful
supernova explosion and its evolution is dominated by neutrino diffusion. Its
neutrino signal is a valuable diagnostic of its internal structure and
composition. During its transformation from a hot, lepton-rich to a cold,
catalyzed remnant, the possibility exists that it can collapse into a black
hole, which abruptly terminates neutrino emissions. The essential microphysics,
reviewed herein, that controls its evolution are the equation of state of dense
matter and its associated neutrino opacities. Several simulations of the
proto-neutron star evolution, involving different assumptions about the
composition of dense matter, are described. After its evolution into a nearly
isothermal neutron star a hundred or so years after its birth, it may be
observable through its thermal emission in X-rays during its life in the next
million years. Its surface temperature will depend upon the rapidity of
neutrino emission processes in its core, which depends on the composition of
dense matter and whether or not its constituents exhibit superfluidity and
superconductivity. Observations of thermal emission offer the best hope of a
determination of the radius of a neutron star. The implications for the
underlying dense matter equation of state of an accurate radius determination
are explored.

  available at http://www.eurico.web.com",,10.1051/0004-6361:20010345,,astro-ph,,"  Recent analyses of helioseismological observations seem to suggest the
presence of two new phenomena connected with the dynamics of the solar
convective zone. Firstly, there are present torsional oscillations with periods
of about 11 years, which penetrate significantly into the solar convection zone
and secondly, oscillatory regimes exist near the base of the convection which
are markedly different from those observed near the top, having either
significantly reduced periods or being non-periodic.
  Recently spatiotemporal fragmentation/bifurcation has been proposed as a
possible dynamical mechanism to account for such observed multi-mode behaviours
in different parts of the solar convection zone. Evidence for this scenario was
produced in the context of an axisymmetric mean field dynamo model operating in
a spherical shell, with a semi-open outer boundary condition and a zero order
angular velocity obtained by the inversion of the MDI data, in which the only
nonlinearity was the action of the Lorentz force of the dynamo generated
magnetic field on the solar angular velocity.
  Here we make a detailed study of the robustness of this model with respect to
plausible changes to its main ingredients, including changes to the alpha and
eta profiles as well as the inclusion of a nonlinear alpha quenching. We find
that spatiotemporal fragmentation is present in this model for different
choices of the rotation data and as the details of the model are varied. Taken
together, these results give strong support to the idea that spatiotemporal
fragmentation is likely to occur in general dynamo settings.

evolution, and internal angular momentum transport.

associated with the damped Lyman-alpha (DLA) absorber at z=1.859 toward the
z_{em}=2.48 quasar QSO 1244+3443, using the HST and the NICMOS. Images were
obtained in the broad filter F160W and the narrow filter F187N with camera 2 on
NICMOS with the goal of detecting the rest-frame optical continuum and the
H-alpha line emission from the DLA. After PSF subtraction, two weak features
are seen at projected separations of 0.16-0.24"" from the quasar. Parts of these
features may be associated with the DLA absorber, although we cannot completely
rule out that they could be artifacts of the point spread function (PSF). If
associated with the DLA, the objects would be ~1-2 h_{70}^{-1} kpc in size with
integrated flux densities of 2.5 and 3.3 mu Jy in the F160W filter, implying
luminosities at lambda_{central}=5600 A in the DLA rest frame of 4.4-5.9 x
10^{9} h_{70}^{-2} L_{solar} at z=1.86, for q0=0.5. However, no significant
H-alpha line emission is seen from these objects, suggesting low star formation
rates (SFRs). Our 3 sigma upper limit on the SFR in the DLA is 1.3 h_{70}^{-2}
M_{solar}/yr for q0 = 0.5 (2.4 h_{70}^{-2} M_{solar} yr^{-1} for q0 = 0.1).
This together with our earlier result for LBQS 1210+1731 mark a significant
improvement over previous constraints on the star formation rates of DLAs. A
combination of low SFR and some dust extinction is likely to be responsible for
the lack of H-alpha emission. Alternatively, the objects, may be associated
with the quasar host galaxy. In any case, our observations suggest that the DLA
is not a large bright proto-disk, but a compact object or a low-surface
brightness galaxy. If the two features are PSF artifacts then the constraints
on DLA properties are even more severe.

correct for the background contribution of field stars, showing the importance

the variability of the density of background stars could be the dominant factor

  Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs","17 pages, 1 figure, accepted by ApJ Letters",Astrophys.J. 548 (2001) L193-L196,10.1086/319091,,astro-ph physics.comp-ph physics.plasm-ph quant-ph,,"  The explosion of a type Ia supernova starts in a white dwarf as a laminar
deflagration at the center of the star and soon several hydrodynamic
instabilities, in particular, the Rayleigh-Taylor instability, begin to act. A
cellular stationary combustion and a turbulent combustion regime are rapidly
achieved by the flame and maintained up to the end of the so-called flamelet
regime when the transition to detonation is believed to occur. The burning
velocity at these regimes is well described by the fractal model of combustion.
Using a semi-analytic approach, we describe the effect of magnetic fields on
the fractalization of the front considering a white dwarf with a nearly dipolar
magnetic field. We find an intrinsic asymmetry on the velocity field that may
be maintained up to the free expansion phase of the remnant. Considering the
strongest values inferred for a white dwarf's magnetic fields with strengths up
to $10^{8}-10^{9}$ G at the surface and assuming that the field near the centre
is roughly 10 times greater, asymmetries in the velocity field higher than
$10-20 %$ are produced between the magnetic polar and the equatorial axis of
the remnant which may be related to the asymmetries found from recent
spectropolarimetric observations of very young SN Ia remnants. Dependence of
the asymmetry with white dwarf composition is also analyzed.

universal baryon fraction and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) determinations of

cosmological parameters at epochs near zero redshift. We show that our estimate
of the present baryon density is in remarkably good agreement with that

RR Lyraes and 11 Cepheids. Our photometry of the red giant branch tip and red
clump is used to derive distances to IC 1613, which are consistent with each
other and with distances based on the variable stars. We compare these values
with similarly-measured distances for the Magellanic Clouds, and are able to
measure metallicity dependencies of the RR Lyrae and Cepheid distances by
requiring consistent relative distance measurements from the four techniques.
For metallicities of [Fe/H] = -1.3 (RR Lyraes) and -1.0 (Cepheids), we find a
relatively steep slope of 0.34 +/- 0.20 magnitudes per dex for the RR Lyraes
and a shallow slope of -0.07 +/- 0.16 mag/dex for the Cepheids, both values
within the range of theoretical and empirical results in the literature. We
find that a dependence of the red clump absolute magnitude on age, in addition
to metallicity, is required to produce self-consistent relative distances
between IC 1613 and the Magellanic Clouds. Adopting such a red clump
calibration and self-consistent calibrations for the other three distance
indicators, we find that the distances to all three objects are in excellent
agreement. Our best distance modulus to IC 1613 is mu_0 = 24.31 +/- 0.06,
corresponding to a distance of 730 +/- 20 kpc. This distance produces an RR
Lyrae absolute magnitude of MV = 0.61 +/- 0.08.

  Enrichment History of the Universe","5 pages, 1 figure, ApJ Letters, accepted",,10.1086/319487,,astro-ph,,"  We compare the metallicity distribution of Galactic Halo stars with 3D
realizations of hierarchical galaxy formation. Outflows from dwarf galaxies
enrich the intergalactic medium inhomogeneously, at a rate depending on the
local galaxy density. Consequently, the first stars created in small
early-forming galaxies are less metal-rich that the first stars formed in more
massive galaxies which typically form later. As most halo stars are likely to
originate in accreted dwarfs, while disk stars formed out of outflow-enriched
gas, this scenario naturally generates a ``metallicity floor'' for old disk
stars, which we find to be roughly coincident with the higher end of our
predicted metallicity distribution of halo stars, in agreement with
observations. The broad and centrally peaked distribution of halo star
metallicities is well reproduced in our models, with a natural dispersion
depending on the exact accretion history. Our modeling includes the important
``baryonic stripping'' effect of early outflows, which brush away the tenuously
held gas in neighboring pre-virialized density perturbations. This stripping
process does not significantly modify the predicted shape of the halo star
metal distribution but inhibits star-formation and hence the number of accreted
stars, helping to reproduce the observed total Galactic halo luminosity and
also the lack of low-luminosity local dwarf galaxies relative to N-body
predictions.

periods range from 1.3 to 15 days. As a group these objects differ from the
usual low-mass binary pulsars (LMBPs): their spin periods of 9-88 ms are
relatively long; their companion masses, 0.2-1.1 Msun, are, in at least some
cases, suggestive of CO or more massive white dwarfs; and some of the orbital
eccentricities, 1e-5 < e < 0.002, are unexpectedly large. We argue that these

different from that of LMBPs. We also note that intermediate-mass binary
pulsars apparently have a smaller scale-height than LMBPs.

assumption that initially the surface brightness profiles of all bulges were
exponential, and that the steepening of the profiles toward the early-types is
due to satellite accretion. The results are positive. After the accretion of a
satellite, bulge-disk fits show that the bulge grows and that the bulge profile
index $n$ increases proportional to the satellite mass. For a satellite as
massive as the bulge, $n$ rises from 1 to 4. We present kinematic diagnostics
on the remnants and disk thickening. The latter suggests that the bulge growth
must have occurred before the last formation of a thin disk in the galaxy. The
thick disks created by the merger are reminiscent of thick disks seen in
early-type edge-on galaxies.
  The efficiency of the process suggests that present day bulges of late-type
spirals showing exponential profiles cannot have grown significantly by
collisionless mergers.

spectroscopy survey confirmed 127 emission-line objects out of 176 observed
candidates and allowed their quantitative spectral classification. We could
classify 76 emission-line objects as BCG/HII galaxies or probable BCGs, 8 - as
QSOs, 2 - as Seyfert galaxies, 2 - as super-associations in a subluminous
spiral and an irregular galaxy, and 37 as low-excitation objects - either
starburst nuclei (SBN), or dwarf amorphous nuclei starburst galaxies (DANS). We
could not classify 2 ELGs. Furthermore, for 5 galaxies we did not detect any
significant emission lines. For 91 emission-line galaxies, the redshifts and/or
line intensities are determined for the first time. Of the remaining 28
previously known ELGs we give either improved data on the line intensities or
some independent measurements. The candidates were taken from three different
samples selected by different criteria. Among our first priority candidates we
achieved a detection rate of emission-line objects (ELGs + QSOs) of 68%, among
which 51% are BCGs. Observations of a random selected sample among our second
priority candidates showed that only ~10% are BCGs. We found that the confirmed
BCGs have usually a blue colour ((B-R) < 1.0) and a non-stellar appearance in
the APM database. Our third sample is comprised of second priority candidates
fulfilling these criteria derived from the APM. Follow-up spectroscopy of a
small subsample indicates that the expected detection rate for BCGs is ~40%.

for interaction between the jets and the NLR and measure the jet speed close to
the core using VLBI, before environmental effects become important. We find
that in radio-quiet AGN, the jets appear slower and have a greater tendency to
bend, and that one-sidedness and flat-spectrum cores are probably due to
obscuration.

Chandra X-ray Observatory. The jet has at least four distinct features which
are not resolved in previous observations. The first knot in the jet (A1) is
very bright in X-rays. Its X-ray spectrum is well fitted with a power law with
alpha = 0.60 +/- 0.05. Combining this measurement with lower frequency data
shows that a pure synchrotron model can fit the spectrum of this knot from
1.647 GHz to 5 keV (over nine decades in energy) with alpha = 0.76 +/- 0.02,
similar to the X-ray spectral slope. Thus, we place a lower limit on the total
power radiated by this knot of 1.5e43 erg/s; substantially more power may be
emitted in the hard X-ray and gamma-ray bands.
  Knot A2 is also detected and is somewhat blended with knot B1. Synchrotron
emission may also explain the X-ray emission but a spectral bend is required
near the optical band. For knots A1 and B1, the X-ray flux dominates the
emitted energy. For the remaining optical knots (C through H), localized X-ray
enhancements that might correspond to the optical features are not clearly
resolved. The position angle of the jet ridge line follows the optical shape
with distinct, aperiodic excursions of +/-1 deg from a median value of
-138.0deg. Finally, we find X-ray emission from the ``inner jet'' between 5 and
10"" from the core.

The ~3% photometry provided by the Global Microlensing Alert Network follow--up
effort reveals a periodic modulation in the lightcurve. We attribute this to
binarity of the lensed source. Microlensing fits to a rotating binary source
magnified by a single lens converge on two minima, separated by delta chi^2 ~
1. The most significant fit X1 predicts a primary which contributes ~100% of
the light, a dark secondary, and an orbital period (T) of 9.2 days. The second
fit X2 yields a binary source with two stars of roughly equal mass and
luminosity, and T = 21.2 days.
  The lensed object appears to lie on the upper LMC main sequence. We estimate
the mass of the primary component of the binary system, M ~2 M_sun. For the
preferred model X1, we explore the range of dark companions by assuming 0.1
M_sun and 1.4 M_sun objects in models X1a and X1b, respectively. We find lens
velocities projected to the LMC in these models of v^hat_X1a = 18.3 +/- 3.1
km/s and v^hat_X1b = 188 +/- 32 k/ms. In both these cases, a likelihood
analysis suggests an LMC lens is preferred over a Galactic halo lens, although
only marginally so in model X1b. We also find v^hat_X2 = 39.6 +/- 6.1 k/ms,
where the likelihood for the lens location is strongly dominated by the LMC
disk. In all cases, the lens mass is consistent with that of an M-dwarf. The
LMC self-lensing rate contributed by 96-LMC-2 is consistent with model

Redshift Survey (2dFGRS) based on a preliminary subsample of 45,000 galaxies.
The BBD is an extension of the galaxy luminosity function incorporating surface
brightness information. It allows the measurement of the local luminosity
density, j_B, and the galaxy luminosity and surface brightness distributions
while accounting for surface brightness selection biases. The recovered 2dFGRS
BBD shows a strong surface brightness-luminosity relation (M_B~2.4\mu_e). The
luminosity-density is dominated by normal galaxies and the luminosity-density
peak lies away from the selection boundaries implying that the 2dFGRS is
complete and that luminous low surface brightness galaxies are rare. The final
value we derive for the local luminosity-density, inclusive of surface
brightness corrections, is: j_B=2.49+/-0.20x10^8 h L_solar Mpc^-3.
Representative Schechter function parameters are: M*=-19.75+/-0.05,
phi*=2.02+/-0.02x10^-2 and alpha=-1.09+/-0.03. Extending the conventional
methodology to incorporate surface brightness selection effects has resulted in
an increase in the luminosity-density of 37%.

single its distance is only 4.1 +- 0.6pc, ranking it as between our twelfth and
fortyth closest neighbour. It is also the closest star or brown dwarf with a
spectral type later than M7V. Its proper motion was determined through
comparison of Sky atlas Schmidt plates, scanned by the MAMA microdensitometer,
with the DENIS images. At 1.53""/yr it further attests the closeness of DENIS

ratio of galaxy groups by analysing the weak lensing signal induced by these
systems. The groups, which have velocity dispersions of 50-400 km/s, have been
selected from the Canadian Network for Observational Cosmology Field Galaxy
Redshift Survey (CNOC2). This survey allows the identification of a large
number of groups with redshifts ranging from z=0.12-0.55, ideal for a weak
lensing analysis of their mass distribution. For our analysis we use a sample
of 50 groups which are selected on the basis of a careful dynamical analysis of
group candidates. We detect a signal at the 99% confidence limit. The best fit
singular isothermal sphere model yields an Einstein radius of 0.72+-0.29"". This
corresponds to a velocity dispersion of 274^{+48}_{-59} km/s (using photometric
redshift distributions for the source galaxies), which is in good agreement
with the dynamical estimate. Under the assumption that the light traces the
mass, we find an average mass-to-light ratio of 191+-83 h Msun/Lsun in the
restframe B band. Unlike dynamical estimates, this result is insensitive to
problems associated with determining group membership. After correction of the
observed mass-to-light ratio for luminosity evolution to z=0, we find 254+-110
h Msun/Lsun, lower than what is found for rich clusters. We use the observed
mass-to-light ratio to estimate the matter density of the universe, for which
we find Omega_m=0.19+-0.10 (Omega_Lambda=0), in good agreement with other
recent estimates. For a closed universe, we obtain Omega_m=0.13+-0.07.

with Nuker, R^1/4, exponential, and Sersic laws, and are also used to derive
the nuclear cusp slopes gamma. We discuss the correlation of nuclear cusp slope
with galactic luminosity, presence of a nucleus, and type of light profile. The
results are compared to those found in the literature for elliptical galaxies
and the bulges of spiral galaxies. We find that as a class the nuclear regions
of dwarf ellipticals are very similar to those of the exponential bulges of
spiral galaxies, and have nuclear cusp slopes shallower than those of bulges
that were well fitted by a de Vaucouleurs R^1/4 profile with the same
luminosity. For the 14 nucleated galaxies in our sample this conclusion is less
certain than for the 11 non-nucleated objects since it relies on an
extrapolation of galaxy light under the nucleus. In terms of their light
profiles and nuclear properties, most spheroidal stellar systems can be broadly
divided into two subclasses: the exponential shallow cusp objects and the
R^1/4, steep cusp objects. Membership of a class does not appear to correlate
with the presence of a massive stellar disk.

neutron stars (NS), with the unique characteristic that none of the two NS ever
had the chance to be recycled by accretion. The existence of this channel stems
from the evolution of helium-rich stars (cores of massive NS progenitors),
which has been neglected in most previous studies of double compact object
formation. We find that these non-recycled NS-NS binaries are formed from bare
carbon-oxygen cores in tight orbits, with formation rates comparable to or
maybe even higher than those of recycled NS-NS binaries. On the other hand,
their detection probability as binary pulsars is greatly reduced (by about
1000) relative to recycled pulsars, because of their short lifetimes. We
conclude that, in the context of gravitational-wave detection of NS-NS inspiral
events, this new type of binaries calls for an increase of the rate estimates
derived from the observed NS-NS with recycled pulsars, typically by factors of
1.5-3 or even higher.

which are relatively narrow and centered at the rest wavelength. We interpret
this as evidence that the high-ionization lines come from a wind, while the
low-ionization lines are emitted from the accretion disk or low-velocity base
of the wind. The optically thick disk blocks our view of the receding wind. We
also found that not all NLS1s display strongly blueshifted emission lines, and
the degree of asymmetry is inversely correlated with the equivalent width and
correlated with the SiIII] to CIII] ratio, a density indicator. It may also be
significant that these NLS1s display the extreme in the X-ray properties: they
have the strongest X-ray soft-excess components and the highest-amplitude,
flaring variability. We postulate that this combination of properties are all
related to a high value of L/M_BH, even among NLS1s. The high-ionization and
low-ionization lines are nearly completely kinematically separated, a fact that
allows us to study the conditions in the disk and wind separately.(...)

  ASP Conference Series, eds. P. Podsiadlowski et al",,,,astro-ph,,"  The radio millisecond pulsar PSR B1620-26 is part of an extraordinary triple
star system in the globular cluster M4. The inner companion to the neutron star
is thought to be a white dwarf of mass m1 ~0.3 Msun in an orbit of period ~0.5
year. The nature and orbital characteristics of the second, more distant
companion, have remained a mystery for many years. A theoretical analysis of
the latest available radio pulsar timing data is presented here, allowing us to
determine approximately the mass and orbital parameters of the second
companion. Remarkably, the current best-fit parameters correspond to a second
companion of **planetary mass**, with m2 ~0.007 Msun, in an orbit of
eccentricity e2 ~0.45 and with a large semimajor axis a2 ~60 AU. The short
dynamical lifetime of this very wide triple in M4 suggests that large numbers
of such planets must be present in globular clusters. We also address the
question of the anomalously high eccentricity of the inner binary pulsar. While
this eccentricity could have been induced during the same dynamical interaction
that created the triple, we find that it could also naturally arise from
long-term secular perturbation effects in the triple, combining the general
relativistic precession of the inner orbit with the Newtonian gravitational
perturbation by the outer planet.

  survey","accepted for publication in ApJ Letters, 6 pages, 2 figures, uses
  emulateapj.sty",,10.1086/318915,,astro-ph,,"  We report the discovery of the galaxy cluster ClJ1226.9+3332 in the Wide
Angle ROSAT Pointed Survey (WARPS). At z=0.888 and L_X=1.1e45 erg/s (0.5-2.0
keV, h_0=0.5) ClJ1226.9+3332 is the most distant X-ray luminous cluster
currently known. The mere existence of this system represents a huge problem
for Omega_0=1 world models.
  At the modest (off-axis) resolution of the ROSAT PSPC observation in which
the system was detected, ClJ1226.9+3332 appears relaxed; an off-axis HRI
observation confirms this impression and rules out significant contamination
from point sources. However, in moderately deep optical images (R and I band)
the cluster exhibits signs of substructure in its apparent galaxy distribution.
A first crude estimate of the velocity dispersion of the cluster galaxies based
on six redshifts yields a high value of 1650 km/s, indicative of a very massive
cluster and/or the presence of substructure along the line of sight. While a
more accurate assessment of the dynamical state of this system requires much
better data at both optical and X-ray wavelengths, the high mass of the cluster
has already been unambiguously confirmed by a very strong detection of the
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect in its direction (Joy et al. 2001).
  Using ClJ1226.9+3332 and ClJ0152.7-1357 (z=0.835), the second-most distant
X-ray luminous cluster currently known and also a WARPS discovery, we obtain a
first estimate of the cluster X-ray luminosity function at 0.8<z<1.4 and
L_X>5e44 erg/s. Using the best currently available data, we find the comoving
space density of very distant, massive clusters to be in excellent agreement
with the value measured locally (z<0.3), and conclude that negative evolution
is not required at these luminosities out to z~1. (truncated)

were selected according to their dust envelope class (as suggested by Sloan,

performed using a code that describes the radiative transfer in dust envelopes
considering core/mantle grains composed by an alpha-SiC core and an amorphous

that considers two kinds of grains - alpha-SiC and A.C. - simultaneously.
Core-mantle grains seem to fit dust envelopes of evolved carbon stars, while
two homogeneous grains are more able to reproduce thinner dust envelopes. Our
results suggest that there exists an evolution of dust grains in the carbon
star sequence. In the beginning of the sequence, grains are mainly composed of
SiC and amorphous carbon; with dust envelope evolution, carbon grains are
coated in SiC. This phenomena could perhaps explain the small quantity of SiC
grains observed in the interstellar medium. However, in this work we consider
only alpha-SiC grains, and the inclusion of beta-SiC grains can perhaps change
some of there results.

burning --, and further discussed on the basis of important empirical
constraints which should be reproduced by theory -- i.e. the initial-final mass
relation, white dwarf mass distribution, carbon star luminosity function, and
chemical abundances of planetary nebulae. We show that present models are able
to reproduce such constraints in a satisfactory way.

polarization vectors on very large scales, we have obtained new polarization
measurements for a sample of quasars located in a given region of the
three-dimensional Universe where the range of polarization position angles was
predicted in advance. For this new sample, the hypothesis of uniform
distribution of polarization position angles may be rejected at the 1.8%
significance level on the basis of a simple binomial test. This result provides
an independent confirmation of the existence of alignments of quasar
polarization vectors on very large scales. In total, out of 29 polarized
quasars located in this region of the sky, 25 have their polarization vectors
coherently oriented. This alignment occurs at redshifts 1-2 suggesting the
presence of correlations in objects or fields on Gpc scales. More global
statistical tests applied to the whole sample of polarized quasars distributed
all over the sky confirm that polarization vectors are coherently oriented in a
few groups of 20-30 quasars. Some constraints on the phenomenon are also
derived. Considering more particularly the quasars in the selected region of
the sky, we found that their polarization vectors are roughly parallel to the
plane of the Local Supercluster. But the polarization vectors of objects along
the same line of sight at lower redshifts are not accordingly aligned. We also
found that the known correlations between quasar intrinsic properties and
polarization are not destroyed by the alignment effect. Several possible
mechanisms are discussed, but the interpretation of this orientation effect
remains puzzling.

studied using the size distribution function of stellar aggregates in kpc-scale
star fields. Achival HST images of 10 galaxies are Gaussian smoothed to define
the aggregates, and a count of these aggregates versus smoothing scale gives
the fractal dimension. Fractal and Poisson models confirm the procedure. The
fractal dimension of star formation in all of the galaxies is ~2.3. This is the
same as the fractal dimension of interstellar gas in the Milky Way and nearby
galaxies, suggesting that star formation is a passive tracer of gas structure
defined by self-gravity and turbulence. Dense clusters like the Pleiades form
at the bottom of the hierarchy of structures, where the protostellar gas is
densest. If most stars form in such clusters, then the fractal arises from the
spatial distribution of their positions, giving dispersed star fields from
continuous cluster disruption. Dense clusters should have an upper mass limit
that increases with pressure, from ~1000 Msun in regions like the Solar
neighborhood to one million Msun in starbursts.

been found.

AKO 9, a UV-bright and highly variable 1.1 day binary system in 47 Tuc. AKO 9
is the brightest FUV source in our data and presents a blue FUV spectrum with
strong CIV and HeII emission lines. Its spectrum is similar to that of the
long-period, DN-type field CV GK Per. Based on this similarity and other
evidence, we suggest that AKO 9 is a long-period CV in which mass-transfer is
driven by the nuclear evolution of a sub-giant donor star.

Orionis (O9.7 Ib). A 73.4 ks HETGS observation shows a wide range of ionization
stages and line strengths over the wavelength range of 5 to 26 A. The observed
emission lines indicate a range in temperature of 2 to 10 MK which is
consistent with earlier X-ray observations of Zeta Ori. Many lines are
spectrally resolved showing Doppler broadening of 900 +/- 200 km/s. The
observed He-like ions (O VII, Ne IX, Mg XI, and Si XIII) provide information
about the spatial distribution of the X-ray emission. Although the observations
support a wind distribution of X-ray sources, we find three conflicting
results. First, line diagnostics for SIXIII indicate that this line emission
forms very close to the stellar surface, where the density is of order 10^{12}
cm^{-3}, but the velocity there is too small to produce the shock jump required
for the observed ionization level. Second, the strong X-ray line profiles are
symmetric and do not show any evidence of Doppler blue-shifted line centroids
which are expected to accompany an outwardly moving source in a high density
wind. Third, the observed velocity dispersions do not appear to correlate with
the associated X-ray source radii velocities, contrary to expectations of wind
distributed source models. A composite source model involving wind shocks and
some magnetic confinement of turbulent hot plasma in a highly non-symmetric
wind, appears to be needed to explain the line diagnostic anomalies.

parameters for over 250 of the galaxies it contains. These parameters include
redshift, rest-frame visible asymmetry and concentration, bolometric luminosity
and extinction-corrected star formation rate. We find only one strong
correlation, between bolometric luminosity and star formation rate, from which
early-type galaxies noticeably deviate. When our asymmetry measurements are
combined with those of a sample of nearby galaxies covering the full Hubble
sequence, we find a weak correlation between redshift and rest-frame visible
asymmetry, consistent with the qualitative evidence of galaxy morphological
evolution from these and other deep Hubble Space Telescope images. The mean
values of these asymmetry measurements show a monotonic increase with redshift
interval over the range 0 < z < 2, increasing by a factor of approximately
three. If this trend is real, it suggests that galaxy morphological evolution
is a gradual process that is continuing through the present cosmological epoch.
There is evidence that the dominant source of this evolution is the ""minor""
mergers of disk galaxies with smaller companions, which could also transform
late-type spiral galaxies into early-type spiral galaxies. Interestingly, in
contrast to local galaxies we find no correlations between star formation rate
and either UV or visible asymmetry. This could arise if the star formation of
high-redshift galaxies proceeds in episodes that are short (~ 100 Myr) relative
to the time scales over which galaxy mergers produce strong asymmetries (~ 500
Myr), a result suggested by the high star formation rates of Lyman break
galaxies.

  More discussion about the origin of high opacity regions",,,,astro-ph,,"  We present an HST STIS spectrum of the HeII Gunn-Peterson effect towards
HE2347-4342. Compared to the previous HST GHRS data obtained by Reimers et al.
(1997), the STIS spectrum has a much improved resolution. The 2-D detector also
allows us to better characterize the sky and dark background. We confirm the
presence of two spectral ranges of much reduced opacity, the opacity gaps, and
provide improved lower limits on the HeII G-P opacity in the high opacity
regions. We use the STIS spectrum together with a Keck--HIRES spectrum covering
the corresponding HI Lya forest to calculate a 1-D map of the softness S of the
ionization radiation along the line of sight towards HE 2347-4342, where S is
the ratio of the HI to HeII photoionization rates. We find that S is generally
large but presents important variations, from S ~ 30 in the opacity gaps to a 1
sigma lower limit of 2300 at z~2.86, in a region which shows an extremely low
HI opacity over a 6.5 A range. We note that a large S naturally accounts for
most of the large SiIV to CIV ratios seen in other quasar absorption line
spectra. We present a simple model that reproduces the shape of the opacity
gaps in absence of large individual absorption lines. We extend the model
described in Heap et al. (2000) to account for the presence of sources close to
the line of sight of the background quasar. As an alternative to the delayed
reionization model suggested by Reimers et al. (1997), we propose that the
large softness observed at z~2.86 is due to the presence of bright soft sources
close to the line of sight, i.e. for which the ratio between the number of HI
to HeII ionizing photons reaching the IGM is large. We discuss these two models
and suggest ways to discriminate between them.

hole. We measure a nuclear X-ray luminosity L_{x} \sim 10^{40} erg/s and show
that the density and temperature profiles of the hot interstellar medium imply
a Bondi accretion rate of Mdot_{Bondi} \sim 3 10^{-2} Msun/yr. This accretion
rate predicts a nuclear luminosity of \sim 10^{44} erg/s for a canonical
radiative efficiency of 10%. Unless the Bondi estimate is inappropriate and/or
the accretion rate onto the black hole is significantly reduced, the observed
nuclear flux constrains the radiative efficiency of the accretion flow to be
\eta \sim 10^{-5}. We show that low-radiative efficiency accretion flows with
radial density profiles \rho \approxpropto r^{-3/2} (and not significantly
flatter) can explain the observed nuclear X-ray luminosity but that the power
output from the jets in NGC 6166 is also important to the energetics of the

anisotropy in the low-redshift universe. We present analytic predictions for
the CMB power spectrum from massive halos arising from the SZ effect. Since
halos are discrete, the power spectrum consists of a Poisson and a correlation
term. The latter is always smaller than the former, which is dominated by
nearby bright rich clusters. In practice however, those bright clusters are
easy to indentify and can thus be subtracted from the map. After this
subtraction, the correlation term dominates degree-scale fluctuations over the
Poisson term, as the main contribution to the correlation term comes from
distant clusters. We find that the correlation term is detectable by Planck
experiment. Since the degree scale spectrum is quite insensitive to the highly
uncertain core structures of halos, our predictions are robust on these scales.
Measuring the correlation term on degree scales thus cleanly probes the
clustering of distant halos. This has not been measured yet, mainly because
optical and X-ray surveys are not sufficiently sensitive to include such
distant clusters and groups. Our analytic predictions are also compared to
adiabatic hydrodynamic simulations. The agreement is remarkably good, down to
ten arcminutes scales, indicating that our predictions are robust for the
Planck experiment. Below ten arcminute scales, where the details of the core
structure dominates the power spectrum, our analytic and simulated predictions
might fail. In the near future, interferometer and bolometer array experiments
will measure the SZ power spectrum down to arcminutes scales, and yield new
insight into the physics of the intrahalo medium.

inflationary scenarios is that primordial fluctuations are exactly Gaussian in
linear order; however, the non-linearity in the inflation will produce weak
non-Gaussianity. Thus, measuring the non-Gaussianity in the cosmic microwave
background radiation anisotropy is a probe of the non-linear physics in the
very early universe. Since the angular three point function is zero for the
Gaussian field, it is sensitive to the non-Gaussianity. We predict its harmonic
transform counterpart, the angular {\it Bispectrum}, down to arcminutes angular
scales, including the full effect of the radiation transfer function. We find
that even the Planck experiment cannot detect the primary bispectrum from the
inflation, as long as the single field slow-roll inflation is right.
Non-linearities in the low redshift universe also produce the non-Gaussianity.
We find that secondary bispectra are detectable by both MAP and Planck
experiments. The secondary bispectra probe the non-linear physics of the
low-redshift universe. Although this could be a contaminant to the primary
signal, MAP and Planck experiments are found to be able to separate the primary
from secondary effects well. We present a tentative comparison of the primary
bispectrum to the published COBE 4 year bispectrum. The data put a weak
constraint on the parameter, and the constraint would become much tighter when
we use all modes available in the COBE data, and certainly forthcoming
satellite experiments. As a conclusion, the bispectrum is a key measure to
confirm or destroy the simple inflationary scenario in non-linear order that
seems quite successful in linear order.

constructed, which represent the result of the accretion induced collapse of
rapidly rotating white dwarfs. The models are built in a two-step procedure:
(1) a rapidly rotating pre-collapse white dwarf model is constructed; (2) a
stationary axisymmetric neutron star having the same total mass and angular
momentum distribution as the white dwarf is constructed. The resulting
collapsed objects consist of a high density central core of size roughly 20 km,
surrounded by a massive accretion torus extending over 1000 km from the
rotation axis. The ratio of the rotational kinetic energy to the gravitational
potential energy of these neutron stars ranges from 0.13 to 0.26, suggesting
that some of these objects may have a non-axisymmetric dynamical instability
that could emit a significant amount of gravitational radiation.

systematic effect on measurements of cosmic shear statistics, known as the

checked against numerical simulations. The semi-analytic calculations have been
performed in a wide variety of generic models for the redshift distribution of
source galaxies and power-law models for the bias parameter between the galaxy
and dark matter distributions. The semi-analytic predictions are tested
successfully against numerical simulations. We find the relative amplitude of
the SLC effect on $S_3$ to be of the order of five to forty per cent. It
depends significantly on the redshift distribution of sources and on the way
the bias parameter evolves. We discuss possible measurement strategies to
minimize the SLC effects.

compare the constraints on cluster mass profiles that can be obtained using the
shear and magnification information. This work considered circularly symmetric
power-law models for clusters at fairly low redshifts where the redshift
distribution of source galaxies could be neglected. Here this treatment is
extended to encompass NFW profiles which are a good description of clusters
from cosmological N-body simulations, and NFW clusters at higher redshifts
where the influence of various scenarios for the knowledge of the redshift
distribution are examined. Since in reality the overwhelming majority of
clusters have ellipsoidal rather than spherical profiles, the singular
isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) is investigated. We also briefly consider the impact
of substructure on such a likelihood analysis. In general, we find that the
shear information provides a better constraint on the NFW profile under
consideration, so this becomes the focus of what follows. The ability to
differentiate between the NFW and power-law profiles strongly depends on the
size of the data field, and on the number density of galaxies for which an
ellipticity can be measured. For higher redshift NFW profiles, there is very
little reduction (~1.5%) in the dispersion of parameter estimates when
spectroscopic redshifts, as opposed to photometric redshift estimates, are
available for the galaxies used in the lensing analysis.

remnant, only an expanding shell. Other types of supernovae are thought to
involve core collapse and are expected to leave a condensed remnant, which

more exotic, such as a quark orstrange star, a naked singularity, a frozen

determine which type of condensed remnant has been formed in those cases where
the diagnostic highly regular pulsar signature of a neutron star is absent. We
consider possible observational differences between the two standard
candidates, as well as the more speculative alternatives.
  We classify condensed remnants according to whether they do or do not possess
three major features: 1)a hard surface, 2)an event horizon, and 3)a
singularity. Black holes and neutron stars differ on all three criteria. Some
of the less frequently considered alternatives are ""intermediate,"" in the sense
that they possess some of the traits of a black hole and some of the traits of
a neutron star. This possibility makes distinguishing the various possibilities
even more difficult.

with or without causal/acausal source. Under the fluid approximation in the
linear theory, we first derive full perturbation equations in flat space with a

analytic solutions for matter perturbations in a flat $\Lambda=0$ model. Some
incorrect solutions in the literature are corrected here. A simple yet accurate
extrapolation scheme is then proposed to obtain solutions in curved or
$\Lambda\neq 0$ cosmologies. Some general features of these solutions are
revealed. In particular, we analytically prove that the resulting matter
density perturbations are independent of the way the causal source was
compensated into the background contents of the universe when it was first
formed. We also use our Green-function solutions to investigate the
compensation mechanism for perturbations with causal seeds, and yield a
mathematically and physically explicit formin interpreting it. We found that
the compensation scale depends not only on the dynamics of the universe, but
also on the properties of the seeds near the horizon scale. It can be
accurately located by employing our Green functions.

parameter $\beta$, in both OCDM and $\Lambda$CDM models. The best fit to the
observed mass power spectra gives $n=0.84\pm 0.67$ and
$\Gamma=0.27^{+0.42}_{-0.16}$, with the theoretically expected degeneracy
$\Gamma'=0.247\Gamma\exp(1.4n)=0.220^{+0.036}_{-0.031}$ (all at 95% confidence
level). Based on this, we then calculate the cluster-abundance-normalized
$\sigma_8$, using different models of mass function: Press & Schechter (1974),
Sheth & Tormen (1999), and Lee & Shandarin (1999). The $\sigma_8$ based on the
non-spherical-collapse models (ST & LS) are significantly lower, mainly due to
the larger mass function within the scale range of our interest. In particular,
we found $\sigma_{8{\rm (ST+LS)}}=0.477\Omega_{\rm m0}^\alpha$, where
$\alpha=-0.3-0.17\Omega_{\rm m0}^{0.34}-0.13\Omega_{\Lambda 0}$. We also derive
the probability distribution function of cluster formation redshift using the
Lacey-Cole formalism (1993), but with modifications to incorporate
non-spherical collapse. The uncertainties in our $\sigma_8$ are mainly
contributed from the normalization in the virial mass-temperature relation. We
also obtain for the IRAS galaxies $\sigma_{8\rm (I)}=0.78\pm 0.06$ (at 95%
confidence level), and found $\beta_{\rm I(ST+LS)}=0.613\Omega_{\rm
m0}^{0.24-0.16(\Omega_{\rm m0}+\Omega_{\Lambda 0})}$. This is more consistent
with the recent observations than the result based on the PS formalism.

shown that there exist two astrophysical scenarios within which the observed
isotopic anomalies can be reproduced simultaneously; one at low entropies
(about 10) which confirms the earlier suggestrd Sn Ia mechanism, and another at
high entropies (about 150) which could be compatible with the neutrino-wind

of galaxies is derived by computing the statistical excess of galaxy counts in
the cluster direction with respect to control fields. Due to the wide field
coverage of the digitised POSS-II plates, we can measure field counts around
each cluster in a fully homogeneous way. Furthermore, the availability of
virtually unlimited sky coverage allows us to directly compute the LF errors
without having to rely on the estimated variance of the background. The wide
field coverage also allows us to derive the LF of the whole cluster, including
galaxies located in the cluster outskirts. The global composite LF has a slope
alpha ~ -1.1+/-0.2 with minor variations from blue to red filters, and M* ~
-21.7,-22.2,-22.4 mag (H_0=50 km/s/Mpc) in g, r and i filters, respectively.
These results are in quite good agreement with several previous determinations
and in particular with the LF determined for the inner region of a largely
overlapping set of clusters, but derived making use of a completely different
method for background subtraction. The similarity of the two LFs suggests the
existence of minor differences between the LF in the cluster outskirts and in
the central region, or a negligible contribution of galaxies in the cluster
outskirts to the global LF.

Kurucz models to the distance, reddening and spectral type of the corresponding
star. The comparison of 8 main-sequence stars studied in detail (alpha Vir,
epsilon Tau, lambda Tau, tau Tau, alpha Leo, zeta Lib, theta Oph, and sigma
Sgr) shows agreement with Kurucz models, but observed fluxes are 10-40% higher
than the models in most cases. The difference in flux between observations and
models is higher in the wavelength range between Lyman alpha and Lyman beta. We
suggest that Kurucz models underestimate the FUV flux of main-sequence B stars
between these two Lyman lines. Computation of flux distributions of
line-blanketed model atmospheres including non-LTE effects suggests that this
flux underestimate could be due to departures from LTE, although other causes
cannot be ruled out. We found the common assumption of solar metallicity for
young disk stars should be made with care, since small deviations can have a
significant impact on FUV model fluxes. Two peculiar stars (rho Leo and epsilon
Aqr), and two emission line stars (epsilon Cap and pi Aqr) were also studied.
Of these, only epsilon Aqr has a flux in agreement with the models. The rest
have strong variability in the IUE range and/or uncertain reddening, which
makes the comparison with models difficult.

ratios between the forbidden (f), intercombination (i), and the resonance (r)

typical of densities found in the solar active regions, and also pressures and
temperatures in Procyon's and Capella's corona at a level of T=10^6K are quite
similar. We find no evidence for densities as high as measured in solar flares.
Comparison of our Capella and Procyon measurements with the Sun shows little
difference in the physical properties of the layers producing the CV, NVI, and
OVII emission. Assuming the X-ray emitting plasma to be confined in magnetic
loops, we obtain typical loop length scales of L_Capella > 8 L_Procyon from the
loop scaling laws, implying that the magnetic structures in Procyon and Capella
are quite different. The total mean surface fluxes emitted in the helium- and
hydrogen-like ions are quite similar for Capella and Procyon, but exceed
typical solar values by one order of magnitude. We thus conclude that Procyon's

Pleiades. Evidence for variability with RMS amplitudes (in the I band) of 0.01
to 0.055 magnitudes on timescales of 0.4 to 100 hours is discovered in half of
these objects. Power spectral analysis using the CLEAN algorithm was performed
to search for evidence of periodic variability. Some objects show strong
periodicities at around a few hours, which could be due to rotational
modulation of the light curve by surface features. However, several objects do
not have any significant periodicities to explain their variability. The vsini
values of a similar population of objects makes it very likely that our time
sampling was sensitive to the expected range of rotation periods, and
simulations show that we would have detected these if they were caused by
long-lived surface features. We argue that this absence of periodicity is due
to the evolution of the brightness, and presumably also the physical size, of
surface features on timescales of a few to a few tens of hours. This is
supported in the case of 2M1145 for which two light curves have been obtained
one year apart and show no common periodicity. The surface features could
plausibly be photospheric dust clouds or magnetically-induced spots. The
recently observed decline in chromospheric activity for late type M and L
dwarfs hints towards the former explanation for at least our later-type
objects. Furthermore, our sample suggests that variability to be more common in
objects later than M9, indicating that the variability may be related to dust
formation. One light curve shows a brief, but significant, dip, which could be
a short-lived feature or possibly an eclipse by a companion. (abridged)

  Properties of the Gamma Rays",Submitted to Astronomy and Astrophysics,,,,astro-ph,,"  Recent observations suggest that gamma ray bursts (GRBs) and their afterglows
are produced by highly relativistic jets emitted in supernova explosions. We
have proposed that the result of the event is not just a compact object plus
the ejecta: within days, a fraction of the parent star falls back to produce a
thick accretion disk. The subsequent accretion generates jets and constitutes
the GRB ``engine'', as in the observed ejection of relativistic ``cannonballs''
of plasma by microquasars and active galactic nuclei. Here we investigate the
production of a GRB as the jetted cannonballs exit the supernova shell reheated
by their collision with it, emitting highly forward-collimated radiation. Each
cannonball corresponds to an individual pulse in a GRB. We cannot predict the
timing sequence of these pulses, but the Cannonball Model fares very well in
describing the total energy, energy spectrum, and time-dependence of the
individual pulses.

coincident with the nucleus of the giant radio galaxy, 3C236. The nuclear radio
structure is composed of two complexes of emission which are resolved on scales
from 1 milli-arcsec (mas) to 1 arcsec. Oscillations with an amplitude of about
5 degrees can be seen in the compact radio structure. Spectral index
distributions are plotted at angular resolutions of 10 and 25 mas and allow us
to identify the core component in the south-east emission complex.
Re-examination of the HST WFPC-2 image of 3C236 by de Koff et al. (2000), shows
that the normal to the dust disk in the nucleus is ~30 degrees from the plane
of the sky and within 12 degrees of parallel to the overall orientation of the
radio source. We suggest that the radio axis is also at an angle of ~30 degrees
to the plane of the sky and that the north-west jet is on the approaching side.
This orientation implies an overall size of 4.5 Mpc (H_o = 75 km/s/Mpc, q_o =
0.5) for 3C236. The coincidence of a dust feature and the south-east compact
jet, within the astrometric errors, leads us to suggest that the dust may be in
the form of a cloud encountered by the jet in the first ~400 pc of its journey
out from the nucleus. One-sided emission at 5 GHz on 1 mas scales would suggest
that the jets are ejected initially at <= 35 degrees to the line of sight, but
this is difficult to reconcile with the obvious orientation stability of the
jet system as a whole. Free-free absorption of the counter-jet may be an
alternative explanation for the one-sideness.

non-cooling flow clusters present evidence of recent merger activity suggesting
that the merger events redistributes efficiently the metal content of the
intracluster medium. For the cooling flow clusters with better statistics and
available optical data (A85, A496, A2029 and Perseus) we have tested whether
the observed abundance excess is due to metals ejected from the galaxies
located in the cluster core. We find that at a resolution > 100 kpc the
observed projected abundance excess profiles are consistent with originating
from a deprojected metal excess distribution tracing the optical light
distribution. In the one case (i.e. Perseus) with higher resolution (~ 50 kpc),
we find that the observed metal abundance excess distribution is broader than
the predicted one. Such a difference can be reconciled if we assume that the
metals have drifted away from their parent ejecting galaxies by a few tens of
kpc, or, alternatively, if we assume that the cluster light profile has become
significantly more centrally peaked because of the formation process of the
central dominant cluster galaxy since the last major merger occurred.

the most outstanding unsolved problems in basic science. One of the best
motivated particle physics candidates is the lightest supersymmetric particle,
assumed to be the lightest neutralino. We here describe DarkSUSY, an advanced
numerical FORTRAN package for supersymmetric dark matter calculations which we
release for public use. With the help of this package, the masses and
compositions of various supersymmetric particles can be computed, for given
input parameters of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model
(MSSM). For the lightest neutralino, the relic density is computed, using
accurate methods which include the effects of resonances, pair production
thresholds and coannihilations. Accelerator bounds are checked to identify
viable dark matter candidates. Finally, detection rates are computed for a
variety of detection methods, such as direct detection and indirect detection
through antiprotons, gamma-rays and positrons from the Galactic halo or
neutrinos from the center of the Earth or the Sun.

sight lines of only 2.5 deg, rather fluffy. The fractional abundance of H_2

typical for galactic disk gas. In the IV and HV gas an apparent underabundance
of neutral oxygen points to an ionization level of the gas of about 90%. H_2 is
detected in IV and HV gas toward HD 269546. In the IV gas we find an H_2 column
density of log(N)\simeq15.6. The H_2 excitation indicates that the line of
sight samples a cloud at a temperature below 150 K. Column densities are too
small to detect the higher UV pumped excitation levels. The high velocity H_2
(log(N)\simeq15.6) is highly excited and probably exposed to a strong radiation

difference between the halo gas and the Milky Way disk, the unattenuated disk

period, have been used to study its spectroscopic evolution. The data cover a
wavelength range from $\sim 3200 - 8000$ \AA and follows the nebular
evolutionary phase of the ejecta. We have modeled the integrated fluxes by
means of the photoionization code CLOUDY. The models were run at a {\it fixed}
abundance value for the most prominent elements (i.e. H, He, C, O, N, Ne, Fe,
etc) over the entire time sequence. It is possible to constrain from this
simple model some of the physical conditions of the gaseous emitting region,
like temperature and density. Compared with previous studies of the gas
abundances of the heavy elements, we found that smaller enhancements of S, N
and Ar, and comparable values for O and Fe, are able to reproduce the
observations. The time evolution of the surface temperature of the ionizing
source and the high-ionization iron lines [Fe VII] 6087 \AA and [Fe X] 6374
\AA, is similar to what it is observed in the soft X-rays. The early line
profiles can be reproduced using a simple kinematical model consisting of an
equatorial ring and polar caps, expanding at a velocity of $\sim 1100$ km/s.
This simple model also approximates the structure of the resolved shell
observed by HST. Considering the complicated structure of the shell, the lack
of well defined values of its gas density and our limited knowledge of the time
evolution of the surface temperature of the photoionization source, the
comparison between models and observations agrees remarkably well.

hypotheses for the formation of binary and multiple stars. A crucial missing
ingredient in previous theoretical studies is the inclusion of dynamically
important levels of magnetic fields. As a minimal model for a candidate
presursor to the formation of binary and multiple stars, we therefore formulate
and solve the problem of the equilibria of isopedically magnetized, singular
isothermal disks, without the assumption of axial symmetry. Considerable
analytical progress can be made if we restrict our attention to models that are
scale-free, i.e., that have surface densities that vary inversely with distance
from the rotation axis of the system. In agreement with earlier analysis by
Syer and Tremaine, we find that lopsided (M=1) configurations exist at any
dimensionless rotation rate, including zero. Multiple-lobed (M = 2, 3, 4, ...)
configurations bifurcate from an underlying axisymmetric sequence at
progressively higher dimensionless rates of rotation, but such nonaxisymmetric
sequences always terminate in shockwaves before they have a chance to fission
into M=2, 3, 4, ... separate bodies. On the basis of our experience in this
paper, and the preceding Paper I, we advance the hypothesis that binary and
multiple star-formation from smooth (i.e., not highly turbulent) starting
states that are supercritical but in unstable mechanical balance requires the
rapid (i.e., dynamical) loss of magnetic flux at some stage of the ensuing
gravitational collapse.

of these sources are spatially correlated with potential galactic gamma-ray
emitters such as supernova remnants, OB associations and early-type stars with
very strong stellar winds. The other half is formed by sources without
positional correlation with known galactic objects capable to generate a gamma
ray flux significant enough as to be detected by EGRET. A variability analysis
shows that this second group of sources contains several objects with high
levels of gamma-ray variability. These variable sources resemble very much the
AGNs detected by EGRET, but without their typical strong radio emission. To
establish the nature of these sources is one of the most urgent problems of
high-energy astrophysics.

of local field subdwarf B (sdB) stars over a period of two years. SdB stars
appear to fall into three distinct groups based on their kinematic and
spectroscopic properties. The sdB's in Group I have no detectable spectral
lines from a cool companion, and show only small or insignificant velocity
variations. They represent about 35% of all sdB stars, which defines the upper
limit for the total fraction of non-binary sdB's. Group II sdB's are
single-lined spectroscopic binaries, comprising about 45% of the sample. Their
spectra resemble those in the first group, but they have significant or large
velocity variations and probable orbital periods on the order of a day. The
third group contains the remaining 20% of sdB's, those showing additional
spectral lines from a cool (FGK) main sequence or subgiant companion. All Group
III sdB's have slowly varying or nearly constant velocities, indicating periods
of many months to several years. Group II sdB's are obvious post-common
envelope systems, in strong contrast to the wide binaries of Group III. Current
data are insufficient to rule out the possibility that some sdB's in Group I
might be analogs of Group III binaries, with undetectably faint companions. The
clear division into three groups with such disparate properties suggests very
different evolutionary histories even though the current physical states are
essentially indistinguishable.

recently discovered counterparts in old open clusters indicates that at least
two thirds of local disk sdB stars are binaries. Our recent radial velocity
survey showed that sdB binaries naturally divide into two groups with
contrasting spectroscopic and kinematic properties. Those with detectable
spectral lines from a cooler companion invariably have periods longer than a
year, while very short period sdB's have essentially invisible companions. We
derive typical orbital separations for the components of the composite spectrum
sdB's from their velocities. The current systems must have been produced by
Roche lobe overflow/mass transfer from low mass, metal-rich giants near the
first red giant branch tip, without undergoing common envelope envolution. The
same process should also occur at slightly lower red giant luminosities,
producing a wide binary with a helium white dwarf instead of an sdB star. Most
short period sdB's probably result from a common envelope following Roche lobe
overflow of the initial secondary onto the white dwarf. Rare post-common
envelope sdB + main sequence (MS) binaries also exist, but available data
suggest that most such systems involving lower MS companions end up merging.
The small and nearly identical masses of the two known MS survivors in short
period sdB binaries imply that both components must have lost a large fraction
of their initial mass in the common envelope process.

ranging from 0.015 pc to 20 pc to simulations of supersonic hydrodynamic and
MHD turbulence computed with the ZEUS MHD code. We use several different
statistical methods to compare models and observations. The Delta-variance
wavelet transform is most sensitive to characteristic scales and scaling laws,
but is limited by a lack of intensity weighting. The scanning-beam
size-linewidth relation is more robust with respect to noisy data. Obtaining
the global velocity scaling behaviour requires that large-scale trends in the
maps not be removed but treated as part of the turbulent cascade. We compare
the true velocity PDF in our models to velocity centroids and average line
profiles in optically thin lines, and find that the line profiles reflect the
true PDF better unless the map size is comparable to the total line-of-sight
thickness of the cloud. Comparison of line profiles to velocity centroid PDFs
can thus be used to measure the line-of-sight depth of a cloud. The observed
density and velocity structure is consistent with supersonic turbulence with a
driving scale at or above the size of the molecular cloud and dissipative
processes below 0.05 pc. Ambipolar diffusion could explain the dissipation. The
velocity PDFs exclude small-scale driving such as that from stellar outflows as
a dominant process in the observed region. In the models, large-scale driving
is the only process that produces deviations from a Gaussian PDF shape
consistent with observations. Strong magnetic fields impose a clear anisotropy
on the velocity field, reducing the velocity variance in directions
perpendicular to the field. (abridged)

The correlation length of flux-limited samples of LBGs depends on their
rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) luminosity at lambda ~1700 Angstrom, with fainter
galaxies being less strongly clustered in space. It decreases by a factor ~3
over the range of limiting magnitudes that we have probed, namely 25<R<27,
suggesting that fainter samples include galaxies with smaller mass. We find
that: 1) the clustering strength of LBGs follows, within the errors, the same
scaling law with the volume density predicted for cold dark matter (CDM) halos;
2) the scaling law predicted for the galaxies using the halos mass spectrum and
a number of models for the relationship that maps the halos' mass into the
galaxies' UV luminosity depends only on how tightly mass and UV luminosity
correlate, but is otherwise insensitive to the details of the models. These
results provide additional evidence that the strong spatial clustering of LBGs
is due to galaxy biasing, supporting biased galaxy formation and gravitational
instability as the primary mechanism for the formation of structure. We also
find that 1) a scale invariant relationship between mass and UV luminosity
(e.g. a power law) is not supported, suggesting that the properties of star
formation of galaxies change along the mass spectrum of the observed LBGs; 2)
the scatter of the UV luminosity of LBGs of given mass must be relatively small
for massive LBGs, suggesting that the mass is an important parameter in
regulating the activity of star formation in these systems, and that the
fraction of massive halos at z~3 that are not observed in UV-selected surveys
is not large.

M_{\sun} within r = 1 h_{65}^{-1} Mpc. The T_x for RX J0849+4452 approximately
agrees with the expectation based on its L_{bol} = 3.3^{+0.9}_{-0.5} X 10^{44}$
erg s$^{-1} according to the low redshift L_x - T_x relation. The very
different distributions of X-ray emitting gas and of the red member galaxies in
the two z > 1 clusters, in contrast to the similarity of the optical/IR colors
of those galaxies, suggests that the early-type galaxies mostly formed before
their host clusters.

  talk at the 33rd COSPAR Scientific Assembly, Warsaw, Poland",,10.1016/S0273-1177(01)00418-5,,astro-ph,,"  Black holes and weakly-magnetic accreting neutron stars show strong
quasi-periodic variability over timescales that span a very wide range. This
property offer us a unique opportunity to improve our understanding of basic
physical processes in strong gravitational fields as it reveals, for the first
time, phenomena that occur on the most fundamental timescales near accreting
compact objects. In this article, I review our current understanding of the
variability properties of accretion flows onto neutron stars and black holes. I
discuss a number of challenges faced by theoretical models, in order to
identify open questions in accretion physics that need to be addressed.
Finally, I discuss the relation to and implications for variability models of
the detection of nearly coherent oscillations during type I X-ray bursts in
several neutron-star sources.

  Influence of ICM Heating","22 pages, 7 figures, to be published in ApJ",,10.1086/319811,"NAOJ-Th-Ap 2000,No.33",astro-ph,,"  We have investigated the ram-pressure stripping of disk galaxies in clusters
at various redshifts and in cluster progenitors; the clusters grow up on a
hierarchical clustering scenario. We consider a radially infalling galaxy whose
initial position and velocity are given by a spherical collapse model of
structure formation. Moreover, since observations show that the intracluster
medium (ICM) of nearby clusters is non-gravitationally heated, we study the
effect of the non-gravitational heating on the ram-pressure stripping. For a
given redshift, we find that ram-pressure stripping has more influence on
galaxies in more massive clusters. On the other hand, for a given mass, it has
more influence on galaxies in the clusters at higher redshifts. In particular,
we predict that in rich clusters at z ~> 1, most of the galaxies are affected
by the ram-pressure stripping. While the non-gravitational heating
significantly reduces the influence of ram-pressure stripping on galaxies in
clusters with mass smaller than 1-5 10^13 M_sun, it does not affect the
influence in richer clusters. If the ICM is heated non-gravitationally at z>>1,
ram-pressure stripping does not occur at z ~ 1-2 in the progenitors of clusters
observed at 0 ~< z ~< 0.5, because the heat makes the ICM fraction of the
cluster progenitors small. On the other hand, if the ICM is heated
non-gravitationally at z ~ 0 for the first time, the ram-pressure stripping
occurs even at z ~ 3. We compare the results with the observations of galaxies
in clusters at various redshifts.

clusters of galaxies based on weak gravitational lensing measurements. We
consider three functional forms for the mass distribution: a softened
isothermal sphere (SIS), the Navarro, Frenk, & White model (NFW) and the
Klypin, Kravstov, Bullock, & Primack model (KKBP). A maximum likelihood
parametric method is developed and applied to simulated images of background
galaxies (z=2.0) lensed by clusters at z=0.2, 0.5, and 0.8. The images have
field size (~10 arcmin) and angular resolution (~0.5 arcsec) characteristic of
the new generation of 8-10 meter-class ground-based telescopes. The method
recovers the correct virial mass of the DM halo, M_{200}, to within ~10% at all
redshifts. The recovered values of \delta_c and r_s are only accurate to ~25%;
however, their correlated errors are such that greater accuracy is obtained for
the mass. Clusters with an SIS density profile are recognized by the method,
while NFW and KKBP clusters are recognized as not being SIS. The method does
not discriminate between NFW and KKBP profiles for clusters of a given mass,
because they are too similar in their outer regions. Strongly lensed arcs near
the cluster centers would be needed to distinguish NFW from KKBP.

(a double source), NGC6121 (marginally significant), NGC6139, and NGC6266; and
outside the cores of NGC6205, NGC6352 and NGC6388. More accurate positions are
determined for the X-ray sources in some ten clusters. The improved position
for the source in NGC6341 excludes the suggested ultraviolet counterpart. It is
shown that one of the two sources reported near the core NGC6626 is spurious,
as is the detection of a pulsar period in the PSPC data of this cluster; the
central source is resolved in three sources. One source reported previously in
NGC6304 is demoted to an upper limit. For 20 cluster cores better upper limits
to the X-ray luminosity are obtained.
  From a statistical analysis I argue that several sources outside the cluster
cores may well belong to the clusters. All spectral energy distributions
observed so far are relatively soft, with bremsstrahlung temperatures =~0.9keV;
there is evidence however that bremsstrahlung spectra do not correctly describe
the spectra. The X-ray luminosity per unit mass for the cluster as a whole does
not depend on the concentration; the luminosity per unit mass for the core may
increase with the cluster concentration.

Galactic Nuclei discs (except in their outer gas pressure dominated regions
where turbulence becomes hypersonic). According to the standard criterion for
viscous stability, ""beta""-discs are always stable throughout. Using realistic
opacities and equation of state, we demonstrate that these discs are thermally
unstable in the temperature domain where hydrogen recombines, when they are
optically thick, and this could lead to limit cycle behavior. Radiation
pressure dominated regions are thermally stable, in contrast with
""alpha""-discs. This results in a fully stable solution for the innermost parts
of AGN discs.

binary that moves against a uniform background of stars. The random impulses

those exerted on a point particle due to inelastic scattering. The frictional
force acting on the binary is less than that acting on a point particle due to
randomization of the trajectories of field stars that pass near the binary.
Both effects tend to increase the random motion of a binary compared with that
of a point mass. If the maximum effective impact parameter for gravitational
encounters is comparable to the radius of gravitational influence of the
binary, its Brownian velocity can be increased by a modest factor compared with
that of a single particle. This condition is probably fulfilled in the case of
binary supermassive black holes in galactic nuclei.

survey is based on the ROSAT All-Sky Survey and on extensive follow-up
observations conducted in the frame of an ESO key program. In the paper we
document the process by which the primary cluster candidate catalogue is
constructed prior to the optical follow-up observations. We describe the
reanalysis of the RASS source catalogue which enables us to impose a proper
flux limit cut to the X-ray source list without introducing a severe bias
against extended sources. We discuss the correlation of the X-ray and optical

positions and the further evaluation of the nature of these cluster candidates.

from radiation by charged particles accelerated near the magnetic poles or in
the outer gaps. In polar cap models, the high energy spectrum is cut off by
magnetic pair production above an energy that is dependent on the local
magnetic field strength. While most young pulsars with surface fields in the
range B = 10^{12} - 10^{13} G are expected to have high energy cutoffs around
several GeV, the gamma-ray spectra of old pulsars having lower surface fields
may extend to 50 GeV. Although the gamma-ray emission of older pulsars is
weaker, detecting pulsed emission at high energies from nearby sources would be
an important confirmation of polar cap models. Outer gap models predict more
gradual high-energy turnovers at around 10 GeV, but also predict an inverse
Compton component extending to TeV energies. Detection of pulsed TeV emission,
which would not survive attenuation at the polar caps, is thus an important
test of outer gap models. Next-generation gamma-ray telescopes sensitive to
GeV-TeV emission will provide critical tests of pulsar acceleration and
emission mechanisms.

  in ApJ; extended discussion w.r.t. original version",,10.1086/320982,,astro-ph,,"  The most popular models for the complex phase and time lags in the rapid
aperiodic variability of Galactic X-ray binaries are based Comptonization of
soft seed photons in a hot corona, where small-scale flares are induced by
flares of the soft seed photon input (presumably from a cold accretion disc).
However, in their original version, these models have neglected the additional
cooling of the coronal plasma due to the increased soft seed photon input, and
assumed a static coronal temperature structure. In this paper, our
Monte-Carlo/Fokker-Planck code for time-dependent radiation transfer and
electron energetics is used to simulate the self-consistent coronal response to
the various flaring scenarios that have been suggested to explain phase and
time lags observed in some Galactic X-ray binaries. It is found that the
predictions of models involving slab-coronal geometries are drastically
different from those deduced under the assumption of a static corona. However,
with the inclusion of coronal cooling they may even be more successful than in
their original version in explaining some of the observed phase and time lag
features. The predictions of the model of inward-drifting density perturbations
in an ADAF-like, two-temperature flow also differ from the static-corona case
previously investigated, but may be consistent with the alternating phase lags
seen in GRS 1915+105 and XTE J1550-564. Models based on flares of a cool disc
around a hot, inner two-temperature flow may be ruled out for most objects

  Background and its Cosmological Implications, IAU Symp. 204, 2000, M. Harwit
  and M. Hauser, eds. (a few typos have been corrected in the original version)",,,,astro-ph,,"  The optical/far-IR extragalactic background light (EBL) from both resolved
and unresolved extragalactic sources is an indicator of the total luminosity of
cosmic structures, as the cumulative emission from young and evolved galactic
systems, as well as from active galactic nuclei (AGNs), is recorded in this
radiation. This is a brief review of some of the implications of the observed
brightness of the night sky for the stellar mass density and average
metallicity of the universe today, and of the possible contribution of MACHO
progenitors and QSOs to the EBL. Assuming a Salpeter initial mass function with
a cutoff below 0.6 M_sun, a lower limit of Omega_{g+s}h^2>0.0015 I_{60} can be
derived to the visible (recycled gas + stars) mass density required to generate
an EBL at a level of I_{EBL}=60 I_{60} nW/m^2/sr: our latest, best-guess
estimate is Omega_{g+s}h^2 ~ 0.0023 I_{60}, which implies a mean metallicity at
the present-epoch of y_Z Omega_{g+s}/Omega_b ~ 0.2 Z_sun. If massive dark halos
around spiral galaxies are partially composed of faint, old white dwarfs, i.e.
if a non-negligible fraction (a few percent) of the nucleosynthetic baryons is
locked in the remnants (MACHOs) of intermediate-mass stars forming at very high
redshifts, then the bright early phases of such halos should contribute
significantly to the observed EBL. Assuming a standard black hole accretion
model for quasar activity and using recent observations of the quasar
population and new synthesis models for the cosmic X-ray background, we
estimate a present mass density of QSO remnants of rho_{BH} ~ 3e5 M_sun/Mpc^3
for a 10% efficiency of accreted mass-to-radiation conversion. The quasar
contribution to the brightness of the night sky is I_QSO ~ 2 nW/m^2/sr.

  (introduction rewritten, added references and comparison with previous work)",Astrophys.J. 556 (2001) 479-493,10.1086/321580,,astro-ph,,"  We treat the problem of adiabatic losses and stochastic particle acceleration
in gamma-ray burst (GRB) blast waves that decelerate by sweeping up matter from
an external medium. The shocked fluid is assumed to be represented by a
homogeneous expanding shell. The energy lost by nonthermal particles through
adiabatic expansion is converted to the bulk kinetic energy of the outflow,
permitting the evolution of the bulk Lorentz factor Gamma of the blast wave to
be self-consistently calculated. The behavior of the system is shown to
reproduce the hydrodynamic self-similar solutions in the relativistic and
nonrelativistic limits, and the formalism is applicable to scenarios that are
intermediate between the adiabatic and fully radiative regimes. Nonthermal
particle energization through stochastic gyroresonant acceleration with
magnetic turbulence in the blast wave is treated by employing energy-gain rates
and diffusive escape timescales based upon expressions derived in the
quasilinear regime. If the magnetic field in the shocked fluid approaches its
equipartition value, this process can accelerate escaping particles to
>~10^{20} eV energies, consistent with the hypothesis that ultra-high energy
cosmic rays (UHECRs) are accelerated by GRB blast waves. Due to particle
trapping by the magnetic turbulence, only the highest energy particles can
escape during the prompt and afterglow phases of a GRB for acceleration by a
Kolmogorov spectrum of MHD turbulence. Lower energy particles begin to escape
as the blast wave becomes nonrelativistic and shock Fermi acceleration becomes
more important.

the method can be easily extended to higher frequency channels. We show that it

accurate, robust, simple and fast reconstruction of the main beam properties
under very general conditions, independently of the calibration accuracy.
  In addition, we find that a bivariate Gaussian approximation of the main beam

elements (silicon and iron) and different transition lines of iron (Fe L and Fe
K). While the Fe XVII L line and Si XIII K line images are globally spatially
coincident, the Fe K emission clearly peaks at a smaller radius, indicating a
higher temperature toward the reverse shock. This is qualitatively the profile
expected when the reverse shock, after travelling through the outer power-law
density profile, has entered the central plateau of the ejecta. The high energy
continuum map has an overall smooth distribution, with a similar extent to the
radio emission. Its radial profile peaks further out than the lines emission.
Brighter and harder continuum regions are observed with a rough bipolar
symmetry in the eastern and western edges. The spectral analysis of the
southeastern knots supports spatial variations of the relative abundance of

ISO and CSO data indicate that the absorbing gas is extremely cold, T_K ~ 10 K,
suggesting that it is located in the dark clouds of the different spiral arms
that intersect the line of sight towards the Galactic Center. From the analysis
of the CO absorption we derive 13CO gas phase column densities of 1.1 and

in the direction of Sgr A* is ~ 2E16 cm-2. The derived CO/H2O and gas/solid

combined with photometric data ranging from the UV through the optical into the
sub-mm region. We defined two key groups, based upon the spectral shape of the
infrared region. The derived results can be summarized as follows: (1) the
continuum of the IR to sub-mm region of all stars can be reconstructed by the
sum of a power-law and a cool component, which can be represented by a black
body. Possible locations for these components are an optically thick,
geometrically thin disc (power-law component) and an optically thin flared
region (black body); (2) all stars have a substantial amount of cold dust
around them, independent of the amount of mid-IR excess they show; (3) also the
near-IR excess is unrelated to the mid-IR excess, indicating different
composition/location of the emitting material; (4) remarkably, some sources
lack the silicate bands; (5) apart from amorphous silicates, we find evidence
for crystalline silicates in several stars, some of which are new detections;
(6) PAH bands are present in at least 50% of our sample, and their appearance
is slightly different from PAHs in the ISM; (7) PAH bands are, with one
exception, not present in sources which only show a power-law continuum in the
IR; their presence is unrelated to the presence of the silicate bands; (8) the
dust in HAEBE stars shows strong evidence for coagulation; this dust processing
is unrelated to any of the central star properties (such as age, spectral type

greater than the average magnetic field, which in turn tends to imply that the

Beginning ~1.5 days after the burst, the light-curves of this GRB steepen
measurably. The existence of such achromatic breaks are usually taken to be an
important observational signature that the ejecta are not expanding
isotropically, but rather have a collimated jet-like geometry. If we interpret
the data in this context, we derive an opening angle of 5 degrees, which
reduces the energy release compared to an isotropic model by a factor of ~275,
to 1.7 x 10^51 erg. To fit the data with a simple jet model requires extinction
along the line of sight. The derived A_V is in the range 0.11 - 0.82 mag,
depending on the adopted extinction law and whether the electrons giving rise
to the optical emission are undergoing synchrotron cooling or not. Since this
is in excess of the expected extinction from our Galaxy, we attribute this to
the GRB host. We note that this extinction is typical of a galactic disk, and
therefore the event likely took place in the disk of its host.

tracking the dynamical evolution of substructure within larger dark halos. The
scheme incorporates the effects of dynamical friction, tidal mass loss and
tidal heating via physically motivated approximations. Using our scheme, we can
predict the orbital evolution and mass-loss history of individual subhalos in
detail. We are also able to determine the impact and importance of the
different physical processes on the dynamical evolution of the subhalos. To
test and calibrate this model, we compare it with a set of recent
high-resolution numerical simulations of mergers between galaxies and small
companions. We find that we can reproduce the orbits and mass-loss rates seen
in all of these simulations with considerable accuracy, using a single set of
values for the three free parameters in our model. Computationally, our scheme
is more than 1000 times faster than the simplest of the high-resolution
numerical simulations. This means that we can carry out detailed and
statistically meaningful investigations into the characteristics of the subhalo
population in different cosmologies, the stripping and disruption of the
subhalos, and the interactions of the subhalos with other dynamical structures
such as a thin disk. This last point is of particular interest given the
ubiquity of minor mergers in hierarchical models. In this regard, our method's
simplicity and speed makes it particularly attractive for incorporation into
semi-analytic models of galaxy formation.

the epoch of thermal relaxation. After the supernova explosion, powerful
neutrino emission quickly cools the stellar core, while the crust stays hot.
The cooling wave then propagates through the crust, due to its finite thermal
conductivity. When the cooling wave reaches the surface (age 10-100 yr), the
effective temperature drops sharply from 250 eV to 30 or 100 eV, depending on
the cooling model. The crust relaxation time is sensitive to the (poorly known)
microscopic properties of matter of subnuclear density, such as the heat
capacity, thermal conductivity, and superfluidity of free neutrons. We
calculate the cooling models with the new values of the electron thermal
conductivity in the inner crust, based on a realistic treatment of the shapes
of atomic nuclei. Superfluid effects may shorten the relaxation time by a
factor of 4. The comparison of theoretical cooling curves with observations
provides a potentially powerful method of studying the properties of the
neutron superfluid and highly unusual atomic nuclei in the inner crust.

  Journal",Astron.J. 122 (2001) 1397-1419,10.1086/322995,,astro-ph,,"  We have simulated the evolution of tidal debris in the Galactic halo in order
to guide our ongoing survey to determine the fraction of halo mass accreted via
satellite infall. Contrary to naive expectations that the satellite debris will
produce a single narrow velocity peak on a smooth distribution, there are many
different signatures of substructure, including multiple peaks and broad but
asymmetrical velocity distributions. Observations of the simulations show that
there is a high probability of detecting the presence of tidal debris with a
pencil beam survey of 100 square degrees. In the limiting case of a single 10^7
Msun satellite contributing 1% of the luminous halo mass the detection
probability is a few percent using just the velocities of 100 halo stars in a
single 1 square degree field. The detection probabilities scale with the
accreted fraction of the halo and the number of fields surveyed. There is also
surprisingly little dependence of the detection probabilities on the time since
the satellite became tidally disrupted, or on the initial orbit of the
satellite, except for the time spent in the survey volume.

massive black hole (MBH) and a gas clump with the mass of $10^6$ $-$ $10^7$
$M_{\odot}$ in the central tens pc of a galactic bulge. We found that strong
tidal gravitational field of the MBH transforms the initial spherical clump
into a moderately thick gaseous disk (or torus) around the MBH. The developed
disk is also found to show rotation, essentially because the tidal field
changes efficiently the orbital angular momentum of the clump into intrinsic
angular momentum of the disk. Furthermore about a few percent of gas mass
(corresponding to a few $10^5$ $M_{\odot}$) in the clump is found to be
transferred to the central sub-parsec region around the MBH within an order of
$10^6$ yr. We thus suggest that successive merging of gas clumps onto a MBH can
not only be associated closely with the formation of nuclear disk around the
MBH but also can provide gas fuel for the MBH.

result suggests that only high-redshift major mergers are now detected by SCUBA

that LMSA (ALMA) with the expected detection limit of the order of 10 $\mu$Jy

reported recently by the AGASA group, is due to a compact black hole dynamo
associated with the Sgr A* source is considered. Under the assumption that the
Galactic center black hole rotates with nearly maximal spin, and that the
magnetic field threading the horizon is in rough equipartition with matter
accreted by the hole, the spectra and total fluxes of accelerated CRs and their
associated curvature emission depend only on accretion rate. For the accretion
rate estimated on the basis of observations of stellar winds near Sgr A* ($\sim
10^{-3}$ Eddington), the maximum proton energy achievable by this mechanism is
of the order of $10^{18}$ eV, and the corresponding CR power is $\sim
10^{41}\alpha_{CR}$ erg s$^{-1}$, where $\alpha_{CR}<<1$ is the CR production
efficiency. The corresponding spectrum of curvature photons peaks at around a
hundred GeV, with a total luminosity comparable to the CR power released. For
much lower accretion rates both the CR and gamma-ray fluxes predicted are
completely insignificant. Upcoming gamma-ray experiments, such as CANGAROO,
HESS and GLAST, can be used to probe the parameters of this system.

cloud-cloud collisions. We find two different solutions for the set of
equations corresponding to two stable cloud regimes: (i) the observed molecular
clouds and (ii) much lighter and smaller clouds which correspond to the
stripped cores of the observed clouds. It is shown that the resulting physical
characteristics of the heavy clouds and the disk are in very good agreement
with all comparable observations at multiple wavelengths. A mass accretion rate
of approx. 10^-4 M_solar/yr for the isolated Circumnuclear Disk is inferred. We
propose that the Circumnuclear Disk has a much longer lifetime (approx. 10^7

transient behavior is attributed to the strong ionization produced in the
circumburst medium by the GRB photons. The high iron abundance points to the
existence of a burst environment enriched by a supernova along the line of

before the burst. Our results agree with models in which GRBs originate from
the collapse of very massive stars and are preceded by a supernova event

in the ASCA spectra of several nearby giant elliptical galaxies are caused by
low-radiative efficiency accretion flows (ADAFs) onto a massive black hole in

derived from the ASCA x-ray spectral analyses indicate that they may be visible
as x-ray point sources. We analyze archival ROSAT HRI images of three such
galaxies, NGCs 1399, 4636, and 4696, to determine whether point x-ray sources
consistent with ASCA-derived fluxes are present in the centers of the galaxies.
We find that the upper limit for the flux of a central point x-ray source in
each of these galaxies as determined by the ROSAT HRI data is only marginally
consistent with the predicted flux inferred from the ASCA spectra. We suggest
that although a central point source, such as a ADAF associated with a massive
black hole, cannot be completely ruled out, they can only account for a
fraction of the flux of the observed hard x-ray power law components.

  The theoretical population ratios are confronted with the corresponding
column density ratios of C I and C II lines observed in damped Ly-alpha (DLA)

physical conditions.
  The volumetric density of neutral hydrogen in DLA systems is constrained to
be lower than tens of cm^-3 (or a few cm^-3 in the best cases) and the UV
radiation field intensity must be lower than two orders of magnitude the

discriminate between the current accepted picture of the UV extragalatic

with <z> = 2.72. It has amplitude Delta^2(k_p)=0.74^0.20_-0.16 at wavenumber
k_p=0.03 (km/s)^-1 and is well described by a power-law of index -2.43 +/- 0.06
or by a CDM-like power spectrum with shape parameter Gamma'=1.3^+0.7_-0.5*10^-3
(km/s) at z=2.72. For Omega_m=0.4, Omega_Lam=0.6, the best-fit Gamma =0.16
(h^-1mpc)^-1, in good agreement with the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey, and the
best-fit sigma_8=0.82 (Gamma/0.15)^-0.44. Matching the observed cluster mass
function and our Delta^2(k_p) in spatially flat models requires
Omega_m=0.38^+0.10_-0.08 + 2.2 (Gamma-0.15). Matching Delta^2(k_p) in
COBE-normalized, flat CDM models with no tensor fluctuations requires Omega_m =
(0.29 +/-0.04) n^-2.89 h_65^-1.9. The Lya forest complements other probes of
P(k) by constraining a regime of redshift and lengthscale not accessible by
other means, and the consistency of these inferred parameters with independent
estimates provides further support for inflation, cold dark matter, and vacuum
energy (abridged).

Microlensing surveys of the bulge of M31, and of M87 in the Virgo cluster, may
provide enough events to differentiate the behaviour of the mass function of
lenses below the hydrogen burning limit (though we find that M87 is a more
favourable target). Such objects may provide a significant supply of baryonic
dark matter, an interesting possibility for the study of galactic dynamics.
Furthermore, these systems have different metallicities than the solar
neighbourhood, which may affect the mass function. These considerations are
relevant in the context of star formation studies.

  Properties and External Environment","21 pages, 9 Figures, 2 Tables; to appear in ApJ",,10.1086/320458,,astro-ph,,"  We have identified a large (~200 kpc), powerful double radio source whose
host galaxy is clearly a disk and most likely a spiral. This FR I radio galaxy
is located very near the center of the RC 0 cluster Abell 428. The existence of
such an object violates a fundamental paradigm for radio loud AGN. In paper I,
we showed that this object was most likely a spiral host with optical line
ratios and colors consistent with an AGN. In this paper, we present new, higher
resolution radio imaging, a radio/mm continuum spectrum for the nucleus, a
detection of HI absorption against the bright radio core, an upper-limit to CO
and the gas mass, and 70 optical redshifts. We confirm the existence of a radio
jet at 20cm extending 42 kpc into the southern lobe. At 3.6cm, we also detect a
nuclear jet similar in length to that in M87 but 10 times weaker. We believe
that this is the first detection of a radio jet on these scales in a disk or
spiral host galaxy. The nuclear radio spectrum is similar to many blazar or QSO
like objects, suggesting that the galaxy harbors an imbedded and obscured AGN.
We model a turnover in the spectrum at low frequencies as Free-Free absorption.
We detect very strong and narrow HI absorption with nearly the entire 20 cm
core continuum absorbed, implying an unusually large optical depth (tau~1). We
suggest that the nucleus is seen through a disk-like distribution of ISM gas,
possibly through a spiral arm or a warp to account for the high column density.
  From the radial velocities, we find that A428 is in fact made up of at least
2 clumps of galaxies separated by 3300 km/s, which are imbedded in a nearly
continuous distribution of galaxies over 13000 km/s in velocity. Thus, the
environment resembles a poor group within a filament viewed end-on.

estimate the degree of electron-ion equilibration by (1) examining the

measuring the widths of the O VI lines. We find significant absorption near the
center of the O VI 1032 line, with less absorption in O VI 1038. The absorption
equivalent widths imply an O VI column density greatly exceeding that of
interstellar O VI along the Cygnus Loop line of sight. We suggest that the
absorption may be due to resonant scattering by O VI ions within the shock
itself. The widths of the O VI emission lines imply efficient ion-ion
equilibration, in agreement with predictions from Balmer-dominated spectra of
this shock.

N-dependance of the dynamical evolution of star clusters. Our clusters consist
of equal-mass stars and are in virial equilibrium. Clusters moving in external
tidal fields and clusters limited by a cut-off radius are simulated. Our main
focus is to study the dependence of the lifetimes of the clusters on the number
of cluster stars and the chosen escape condition.
  We find that star clusters in external tidal fields exhibit a scaling problem
in the sense that their lifetimes do not scale with the relaxation time.
Isolated clusters show a similar problem if stars are removed only after their
distance to the cluster centre exceeds a certain cut-off radius. If stars are
removed immediately after their energy exceeds the energy necessary for escape,
the scaling problem disappears.
  We show that some stars which gain the energy necessary for escape are
scattered to lower energies before they can leave the cluster. Since the
efficiency of this process decreases with increasing particle number, it causes
the lifetimes not to scale with the relaxation time. Analytic formulae are
derived for the scaling of the lifetimes in the different cases.

structure of the keV thermal gas is remarkably complex, particularly in regions
surrounding the the radio source and sites of star formation in CDGs. The radio
sources are displacing the thermal gas leaving cavities filled with radio
emission. The cavities are apparently supported against the local gas pressure
by magnetic fields and cosmic rays. In addition, radio-faint, ``ghost''
cavities are seen in some clusters. They may be relics of earlier radio
outbursts rising buoyantly in the intracluster medium. The radio sources may
reduce the mass deposition rates by mechanical heating, and by inducing
convective currents that move cool material outward.

cosmic-ray intensity, and deposited radiation dose during passages through the
South-Atlantic Anomaly. The characteristic variation of the event rate due to a
specific isotope depends on its life-time, orbital parameters such as the
altitude of the satellite above Earth, and the solar cycle. A detailed
understanding of the background contributions from instrumental lines is
crucial at MeV energies for measuring the cosmic diffuse gamma-ray background

  Galaxies', Rome, June 2000",,,,astro-ph,,"  I highlight recent progress in our understanding of the origin of disk galaxy
scaling laws in a hierarchically clustering universe. Numerical simulations of
galaxy formation in Cold Dark Matter (CDM) dominated universes indicate that
the slope and scatter of the I-band Tully-Fisher (TF) relation are well
reproduced in this model, although not, as proposed in recent work, because of
the cosmological equivalence between halo mass and circular velocity, but
rather as a result of the dynamical response of the halo to the assembly of the
luminous component of the galaxy. The zero-point of the TF relation is
determined mainly by the stellar mass-to-light ratio ($\Upsilon_I$) as well as
by the concentration ($c$) of the dark halo. For $c \sim 10$, as is typical of
halos formed in the ``concordance'' $\Lambda$CDM model, we find that this
requires $\Upsilon_I \sim 1.5$, in reasonable agreement with the mass-to-light
ratios expected of stellar populations with colors similar to those of TF
galaxies. This conclusion supersedes that of Navarro & Steinmetz (2000a,b), who
claimed the $\Lambda$CDM halos were too concentrated to be consistent with the
observed TF relation. The disagreement can be traced to inconsistencies in the
normalization of the power spectrum used in that work. Our new results show
that simulated disk galaxies in the $\Lambda$CDM scenario are not clearly
inconsistent with the observed I-band Tully-Fisher relation. On the other
hand,their angular momenta is much lower than observed. Accounting
simultaneously for the spin, size and luminosity of disk galaxies remains a
challenge for hierarchical models of galaxy formation.

in some Lyman-Werner bands. While these shells exist, this feedback effect is
important in reducing the H_2 dissociating background flux and the size of
photo-dissociation spheres around each luminous object. The maximum background
opacity of the IGM in the H_2 Lyman-Werner bands is \tau_{H_2} ~ 1-2 for a
relic molecular fraction x_{H_2}=2 x 10^{-6}, about 6 times greater than found
by Haiman, Abel & Rees. Therefore, the relic molecular hydrogen can decrease
the photo-dissociation rate by about an order of magnitude. The problem is
relevant to the formation of small primordial galaxies with masses M_{DM} <
10^8 M_\odot, that rely on molecular hydrogen cooling to collapse.
Alternatively, the universe may have remained dark for several hundred million

field resulting from intrinsic spin alignments is not curl free. This provides
a powerful discriminant between lensing and intrinsic contributions to observed
ellipticity correlations. We also show how these contributions can be
disentangled statistically from the ellipticity correlations or computed
locally from circular integrals of the ellipticity field. This allows for an
unambiguous detection of intrinsic galaxy alignments in the data. When the
distortions are dominated by lensing, as occurs at high redshifts, the
decomposition provides a valuable tool for understanding properties of the
noise and systematic errors. These techniques can be applied equally well to
the polarization of the microwave background, where it can be used to separate
curl-free scalar perturbations from those produced by gravity waves or defects.

dependence of the concentration of galaxy-sized dark matter halos. It is found
that dark halo concentrations depend on the amplitude of mass fluctuations as
well as on the ratio of power between small and virial mass scales. This
finding is consistent with the original results of Navarro, Frenk & White
(NFW), and allows their model to be extended to include power spectra
substantially different from Cold Dark Matter (CDM). In particular, the
single-parameter model presented here fits the concentration dependence on halo
mass for truncated power spectra, such as those expected in the warm dark
matter scenario, and predicts a stronger redshift dependence for the
concentration of CDM halos than proposed by NFW. The latter conclusion confirms
recent suggestions by Bullock et al., although this new modeling differs from
theirs in detail. These findings imply that observational limits on the
concentration, such as those provided by estimates of the dark matter content
within individual galaxies, may be used to constrain the amplitude of mass
fluctuations on galactic and subgalactic scales. The constraints on
$\Lambda$CDM models posed by the dark mass within the solar circle in the Milky
Way and by the zero-point of the Tully-Fisher relation are revisited, with the
result that neither dataset is clearly incompatible with the `concordance'
($\Omega_0=0.3$, $\Lambda_0=0.7$, $\sigma_8=0.9$) $\Lambda$CDM cosmogony. This
conclusion differs from that reached recently by Navarro & Steinmetz, a

their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and their redshifts are determined
with typical errors of delta z <= 0.03. We have split our sample into four
redshift bins between z=0.1 and z=1.04 and into three SED bins E-Sa,Sa-Sc and
starbursting (emission line) galaxies. The evolution of the luminosity function
is clearly differential with SED. The normalization phi* of luminosity function
for the E-Sa galaxies decreases towards higher redshift, and we find evidence
that the comoving galaxy space density decreases with redshift as well. In
contrast, we find phi* and the comoving space density increasing with redshift
for the Sa-Sc galaxies. For the starburst galaxies we find a steepening of the
luminosity function at the faint end and their comoving space density increases
with redshift.

dark matter has to take into consideration spatial inhomogeneities on
sub-galactic scales seen, for instance, in high-resolution N-body simulations
of structure formation. Also in more idealized, analytic models, there appear
density enhancements in certain regions of the halo. We use the results from a
recent N-body simulation of the Milky Way halo and investigate the gamma-ray
flux which would be produced when a specific dark matter candidate, the
neutralino, annihilates in regions of enhanced density. The clumpiness found on
all scales in the simulation results in very strong gamma-ray signals which
seem to already rule out some regions of the supersymmetric parameter space,
and would be further probed by upcoming experiments, such as the GLAST
gamma-ray satellite. As an orthogonal model of structure formation, we also
consider Sikivie's simple infall model of dark matter which predicts that there
should exist continuous regions of enhanced density, caustic rings, in the dark
matter halo of the Milky Way. We find, however, that the gamma-ray signal from
caustic rings is generally too small to be detectable.

solar mass star. Here we point out that the observations of the late light
curve of SN 1054, from the historical records, are not compatible with the
standard scenario, in which the late time emission is powered by the
radioactive decay of small amounts of Ni-56. Based on model calculations we
quantify this discrepancy. The rather large mass of Ni-56 needed to power the
late time emission, 0.06[-0.03,+0.02] solar masses, seems inconsistent with
abundances in the Crab nebula. The late light curve may well have been powered
by the pulsar, which would make SN 1054 unique in this respect. Alternatively,
the late light curve could have been powered by circumstellar interaction, in
accordance with scenarios in which 8-10 solar mass stars are progenitors to
`dense wind' supernovae.

of the compact and unusual radio galaxy 3C 346, combining information from
ROSAT and ASCA. The dominant component of X-ray emission (~ 10^44 ergs/s in
each of the 0.5-3 keV and 2-10 keV bands) is unresolved and not heavily
absorbed (intrinsic N_H ~< 2 10^21 cm^-2), with evidence for variability of 32
+/- 13% over 18 months. We relate the X-ray emission to radio structures on
both milliarcsecond scales and the arcsecond scales which Chandra can resolve.
The absence of X-ray absorption, and the radio/optical/X-ray colors, when
combined with previous radio evidence that the source is a foreshortened FRII,
suggest that the radio jets are seen at an angle to the line of sight of about
30 degrees, intermediate between the radio-galaxy and quasar classes. Roughly a
third of the soft X-ray emission is from a cluster atmosphere, for which we
measure a temperature of 1.9 (+1.3, -0.7) keV, making this the second
low-redshift (z < 0.2) powerful radio galaxy, after Cygnus A, with a measured
cluster temperature. At a jet angle of ~ 30 degrees, all the radio structures
lie within the core radius of the cluster, for which the cooling time is
sufficiently long that there is no reason to expect the presence of a cooling
flow. The radio lobes of 3C 346 are roughly in pressure balance with the
external medium under the assumptions that the energy densities in the magnetic
field and radiating particles balance and that a source of excess pressure in
the radio lobes, commonly invoked in other radio galaxies, is absent here.

substantial variety of line profiles, from Gaussians of less than ten km/s to

absorption, sometimes spanning many hundreds of km/s. The chance to detect
appreciable HI absorption is greatest in the most compact radio sources, GPSs

in gas enveloping jets and hot spots; inferred densities range at least between
10 per cubic cm and 10000 per cubic cm. But HI absorption occurs also in some
CSSs, perhaps associated with jet-cloud interaction regions, and in quasars

discs of cataclysmic variables (CVs). Doppler tomography is ideally suited to
resolve and map such co-rotating patterns and allows a straightforward
comparison with theory. The dwarf nova IP Pegasi presents the best studied
case, carrying two spiral arms in a wide range of emission lines throughout its
outbursts. Both arms appear at the locations where tidally driven spiral waves
are expected, with the arm closest to the gas stream weaker in the lines
compared to the arm closest to the companion. Eclipse data indicates
sub-Keplerian velocities in the outer disc. The dramatic disc structure changes
in dwarf novae on timescales of days to weeks, provide unique opportunities for
our understanding of angular momentum transport and the role of density waves
on the structure of accretion discs.
  I present an extension to the Doppler tomography technique that relaxes one
of the basic assumptions of tomography, and is able to map modulated emission
sources. This extension allows us to fit anisotropic emission from, for
example, spiral shocks, the irradiated companion star and disc-stream
interaction sites.

approximately 1/4\Zs. The spectra have a resolution of 1\AA and cover the
spectral range 1200-1600\AA. A set of model spectra was calculated for a
standard initial mass function and star-formation history and is compared to
synthetic spectra at solar metallicity. We find that the spectral lines are
generally weaker at lower metallicity, as expected from the lower elemental
abundances. Stellar-wind lines, however, show a more complex behavior: the
metallicity dependence of the ionization balance can be important in trace
ions, like N$^{4+}$ and Si$^{3+}$. Therefore the strength of \nv and \siiv does
not scale monotonically with metallicity. We compare our new models to
ultraviolet spectra of NGC 5253 and \cB, two star-forming galaxies with 1/4

provides significantly better fits to the observations than earlier models

  Journal",,10.1086/320240,,astro-ph,,"  We show that magnetized, radiation dominated atmospheres can support steady
state patterns of density inhomogeneity that enable them to radiate at far
above the Eddington limit, without suffering mass loss. The inhomogeneities
consist of periodic shock fronts bounding narrow, high-density regions,
interspersed with much broader regions of low density. The radiation flux
avoids the regions of high density, which are therefore weighed down by
gravity, while gas in the low-density regions is slammed upward into the shock
fronts by radiation force. As the wave pattern moves through the atmosphere,
each parcel of matter alternately experiences upward and downward forces, which
balance on average. Magnetic tension shares the competing forces between
regions of different densities, preventing the atmosphere from blowing apart.
We calculate the density structure and phase speed of the wave pattern, and
relate these to the wavelength, the density contrast, and the factor by which
the net radiation flux exceeds the Eddington limit. In principle, this factor
can be as large as the ratio of magnetic pressure to mean gas pressure, or the
ratio of radiation pressure to gas pressure, whichever is smaller. Although the
magnetic pressure must be large compared to the mean gas pressure in order to
support a large density contrast, it need not be large compared to the
radiation pressure. These highly inhomogeneous flows could represent the
nonlinear development of the ""photon bubble"" instability discovered by Gammie.
We briefly discuss the applicability of these solutions to astrophysical
systems.

between five identical late-type disk galaxies with the special emphasis on
star formation history and chemical evolution of multiple galaxy mergers. We
found that multiple encounter and merging can trigger repetitive massive
starbursts (typically $\sim$ 100 $M_{\odot}$ ${\rm yr}^{-1}$) owing to the
strong tidal disturbance and the resultant gaseous dissipation during merging.
The magnitude of the starburst is found to depend on initial virial ratio
(i.e., the ratio of total kinematical energy to total potential energy) such
that the maximum star formation rate is larger for the merger with smaller
virial ratio. Furthermore we found that the time interval between the epochs of
the triggered starbursts is longer for the merger with the larger virial ratio.
The remnant of a multiple galaxy merger with massive starbursts is found to
have metal-poor gaseous halo that is formed by tidal stripping during the
merging. We accordingly suggest that metal-poor gaseous halo in a field
elliptical galaxy is a fossil record of the past multiple merging events for
the galaxy.

(the Blandford-McKee, BMK, solution) are calculated. The BMK solution is shown
to be stable and strongly non-universal. It is stable because all the
eigenmodes decay. Non-universality of the BMK solution (BMK is not an
intermediate asymptotic) is a consequence of causality. In terms of eigenmodes
-- some eigenmodes decay too slowly. For each degree l, there exists an
eigenmode which decays at the smallest rate. The amplitude of this eigenmode,
defined as relative perturbation of energy behind the shock front, is constant
at early time. Later, when the blast wave slows down to Gamma = l/10, an
oscillatory decay commences, and the amplitude drops to less than 10% of the
initial value at Gamma = l/100. The non-universality is surprisingly strong.
Near the end of the ultra-relativistic stage, perturbations with l<200, that is
more than 10,000 different harmonics, are suppressed by less than a factor of
10. Spherical symmetry is only reached by the time the blast wave slows down to
non-relativistic velocities, when the Sedov/Taylor/von Neumann solution sets
in.

(ULIRGs) with the total infrared luminosity ($L_{\rm IR}$ for $8\sim 1000$
$\mu$m) of $\sim$ $10^{12}$ $L_{\odot}$. Main results are the following three.
(1) Global colors and absolute magnitudes the during dusty starburst of a major
merger do not change with time significantly, because interstellar dust heavily
obscures young starburst populations that could cause rapid evolution of
photometric properties of the merger. (2) Dust extinction of stellar
populations in a galaxy merger with large infrared luminosity ($L_{\rm IR}$ $>$
$10^{11}$ $L_{\odot}$) is selective in the sense that younger stellar
populations are preferentially obscured by dust than old ones. This is because
younger populations are located in the central region where a larger amount of
dusty interstellar gas can be transferred from the outer gas-rich regions of
the merger. (3) Both $L_{\rm IR}$ and the ratio of $L_{\rm IR}$ to $B$ band
luminosity $(L_{\rm B}$) increases as the star formation rate increase during
the starburst of the present merger model, resulting in the positive
correlation between $L_{\rm IR}$ and $L_{\rm IR}/L_{\rm B}$.

authors. In this paper, we model the spectral, dynamical and morphological
evolution of a prime candidate for producing this spectral signature: a dusty
starburst associated with a major galaxy merger. We show that as this system
evolves dynamically, its spectral type changes from and ``e(a)'' type
(exhibiting strong H$\delta$ absorption and modest [OII] emission -- the
identifying features of local dusty starburst galaxies) to a k+a type and then
finally to a passive ``k'' type. This result shows that galaxies with an e(a)
spectral type can be precursors to the k+a systems and that dynamical evolution
greatly controls the spectral evolution in these merger cases. Our simulations
also show that a merger with very high infrared luminosity ($L_{\rm IR}$ $>$
$10^{11}$ $L_{\odot}$) is more likely to show an e(a) spectrum, which implies
that spectral types can be correlated with infrared fluxes in dusty starburst
galaxies. Based on these results, we discuss the origin of the evolution of
k+a/a+k galaxies in distant clusters and the role merging is likely to have.

  System: A Clue to the Origin of M31'S Nucleus","9 pages 3 figures, already puplished in ApJL, 540, L79",,10.1086/312883,,astro-ph,,"  The central bulge of M31 is observed to have two distinct brightness peaks
with the separation of $\sim$ 2 pc. Tremaine (1995) recently proposed a new
idea that the M31's nucleus is actually a single thick eccentric disk
surrounding the central super-massive black hole. In order to explore the
origin of the proposed eccentric disk, we numerically investigate the dynamical
evolution of a merger between a central massive black hole with the mass of
$\sim$ $10^7$ $M_{\odot}$ and a compact stellar system with the mass of $\sim$
$10^6$ $M_{\odot}$ and the size of a few pc in the central 10 pc of a galactic
bulge. We found that the stellar system is destroyed by strong tidal field of
the massive black hole and consequently forms a rotating nuclear thick stellar
disk. The orbit of each stellar component in the developed disk is rather
eccentric with the mean eccentricity of $\sim$ 0.5. These results imply that
the M31's nuclear eccentric disk proposed by Tremaine (1995) can be formed by
merging between a central massive black hole and a compact stellar system. We
furthermore discuss when and how a compact stellar system is transferred into
the nuclear region around a massive black hole.

once considered unrelated, are linked within a chain that may extend for
parsecs in either direction of the embedded protostar forming a ""giant
Herbig-Haro jet"". Presently, several dozen of these giant flows have been
detected and the best documented example, the HH~34 system, shows a systematic
velocity decrease with distance on either side of the source. In this paper, we
have modeled giant jets by performing fully three-dimensional simulations of
overdense, radiatively cooling jets modulated with long-period
  (P $\sim$ several hundred years) and large amplitude sinusoidal velocity
variability at injection ($\Delta v \sim$ mean jet flow velocity). Allowing
them to travel over a distance well beyond the source, we have found that
multiple travelling pulses develop and their velocity indeed falls off smoothly
and systematically with distance. This deceleration is fastest if the jet is
pressure-confined, in which case the falloff in velocity is roughly consistent
with the observations. The deceleration occurs as momentum is transferred by
gas expelled sideways from the traveling pulses. The simulation of a
pressure-confined, steady-state jet with similar initial conditions to those of
the pulsed jet shows that the flow in this case experiences $acceleration$.
This result is thus an additional indication that the primary source of
deceleration in the giant flows $cannot$ be attributed to braking of the jet
head against the external medium.

This is contrary to what is found in several recent studies of the galactic
age-metallicity relation. This is tentative evidence that there might not exist
a one-to-one relation between age and metallicity for all stars. This is not
surprising considering the current models of the independent evolution of the
different galactic components. We also find that one star, HD 182572, could
with ~ 75 % chance be a thick disk star with, for the thick disk, an extremely
high metallicity at 0.34 dex. This star is, intriguingly, also somewhat
enhanced in the alpha-elements.

temperature) in the disks of the Be stars and the Be/X-ray binaries seem to be
identical.
  However, we do detect some intriguing differences between the envelopes. On
average, the circumstellar disks of the Be/X-ray binaries are twice as dense as
the disks of the isolated Be stars. The different distribution of the Be/X-ray
binaries and the Be stars seen in the full width at half maximum (FWHM) versus

average a smaller size, probably truncated by the compact object.

QSOs is shown to follow a power law on scales s~1-35h-1Mpc. Fitting a power law
to QSO clustering averaged over the redshift interval 0.3<z<2.9 we find
s_0=3.99+0.28-0.34h-1Mpc and gamma=1.58+0.10-0.09 for an Einstein-de Sitter
cosmology (EdS). With Omega_0=0.3 and lambda_0=0.7 the power law extends to
s~60h-1Mpc with a best fit of s_0=5.69+0.42-0.50h-1Mpc and
gamma=1.56+0.10-0.09. These values, measured at a mean redshift of z=1.49, are
comparable to the clustering of local optically selected galaxies. We measure
the evolution of QSO clustering as a function of redshift. For an EdS cosmology
there is no evolution in comoving coordinates over the redshift range of the
2QZ. For Omega_0=0.3 and lambda_0=0.7 QSO clustering shows a marginal increase
at high redshift. Although the clustering of QSOs is measured on large scales
where linear theory should apply, the evolution of QSO clustering does not
follow the linear theory predictions for growth via gravitational instability
(rejected at the >99 per cent confidence level). A redshift dependent bias is
required to reconcile QSO clustering observations with theory. A simple biasing
model, in which QSOs have cosmologically long lifetimes (or alternatively form
in peaks above a constant threshold in the density field) is acceptable in an
EdS cosmology, but is only marginally acceptable if Omega_0=0.3 and
lambda_0=0.7. Biasing models which assume QSOs form over a range in redshift,
based on the Press-Schechter formalism are approximately consistent with QSO
clustering evolution (abridged).

sample to define the fiducial period-luminosity (PL) relations, (2) a more
recent HST Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) photometric calibration,
(3) a correction for Cepheid metallicity, and (4) a correction for
incompleteness bias in the observed Cepheid PL samples. New, revised distances
are given for the 18 spiral galaxies for which Cepheids have been discovered as
part of the Key Project, as well as for 13 additional galaxies with published
Cepheid data. The new calibration results in a Cepheid distance to NGC 4258 in
better agreement with the maser distance to this galaxy. Based on these revised
Cepheid distances, we find values (in km/sec/Mpc) of H0 = 71 +/- 2 (random) +/-

(HST) Cepheid distance to the galaxy NGC 4258 obtained using the calibrations
and methods then standard for the Key Project on the Extragalactic Distance
Scale. Here, we reevaluate the Cepheid distance using the revised Key Project
procedures described in Freedman et al. (2001). These revisions alter the zero
points and slopes of the Cepheid Period-Luminosity (P-L) relations derived at
the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), the calibration of the HST WFPC2 camera, and
the treatment of metallicity differences. We also provide herein full
information on the Cepheids described in Maoz et al. 1999. Using the refined
Key Project techniques and calibrations, we determine the distance modulus of
NGC 4258 to be 29.47 +/- 0.09 mag (unique to this determination) +/- 0.15 mag
(systematic uncertainties in Key Project distances), corresponding to a metric
distance of 7.8 +/- 0.3 +/- 0.5 Mpc and 1.2 sigma from the maser distance of
7.2 +/- 0.5 Mpc. We also test the alternative Cepheid P-L relations of Feast
(1999), which yield more discrepant results. Additionally, we place weak limits
upon the distance to the LMC and upon the effect of metallicity in Cepheid
distance determinations.

several effects expected to be observed. It is likely that accretion disks are
around the supermassive black hole. Stellar interactions with the accretion
flows around the supermassive black hole play a role in that an flying-by star
may cool a hot accretion disk as a result of Comptonization. It is shown that
the Comptonization of the stellar emission will take place in a hot accretion
disk such as the ADAFs around the supermassive black hole and become a
relatively important source of the accretion disk cooling when the mass
accretion rate is low, and stars are passing outer parts of the hot accretion
disk. We suggest that such a stellar cooling can be observed in the radio
frequency regime since synchrotron luminosity of the ADAFs depends strongly on
the electron temperature and occurs much more frequently than a tidal
disruption event.

round elliptical galaxies, we have investigated the dynamical family relations
of ellipticals: (i) The circular velocity curves (CVCs) of elliptical galaxies
are flat to within ~10% for R>~0.2R_e. (ii) Most ellipticals are moderately
radially anisotropic; their dynamical structure is surprisingly uniform. (iii)
Elliptical galaxies follow a Tully-Fisher (TF) relation, with v_c^max=300 km/s
for an L_B^* galaxy. At given v_c^max, they are ~1 mag fainter in B and appear
to have slightly lower baryonic mass than spirals even for maximum M/L_B. (iv)
The luminosity dependence of M/L_B is confirmed. The tilt of the Fundamental
Plane is not caused by dynamical non-homology, nor only by an increasing dark
matter fraction with L. It is, however, consistent with stellar population
models based on published metallicities and ages. The main driver is therefore
probably metallicity, and a secondary population effect is needed to explain
the K-band tilt. (v) These results make it likely that elliptical galaxies have
nearly maximal M/L_B (minimal halos). (vi) Despite the uniformly flat CVCs,
there is a spread in cumulative M/L_B(r). Some galaxies have no indication for
dark matter within 2R_e, whereas others have local M/L_Bs of 20-30 at 2R_e.
(vii) In models with maximum stellar mass, the dark matter contributes ~10-40%
of the mass within R_e. (viii) The corresponding halo core densities and
phase-space densities are at least ~25 times larger and the halo core radii ~4
times smaller than in spiral galaxies of the same v_c^max. The increase in M/L
sets in at ~10 times larger acceleration than in spirals. This could imply that
elliptical galaxy halos collapsed at high redshift or that some of the dark
matter in ellipticals might be baryonic. (abridged)

located in NGC7078, all the other spectra are well represented by a two
component model consisting of a disk-blackbody and Comptonized emission. The
measured low-energy absorptions are in good agreement with those predicted from
optical measurements of the host globular clusters. This implies that there is
little intrinsic X-ray absorption within the binaries themselves, and that the
above spectral model provides a good representation of the low-energy continua.
The sources can be divided into two groups. In the first group, composed of 3
ultra-compact (orbital period <1hr) sources, the disk-blackbody temperatures
and inner-radii appear physically realistic and the Comptonization seed photons
temperatures and radii of the emission areas are consistent with the disk
temperatures and inner radii. For all the other sources, the disk-blackbody
parameters appear not to be physically realistic and the Comptonization
parameters are unrelated to those of the disk-blackbody emission. If this is a
spectral signature of ultra-compact binaries, this implies that no other
ultra-compact binaries are present among those studied here. It is unclear why
this difference between the two types of binaries should exist.

spiral galaxy NGC 4522 are presented. A velocity field up to a radius of 60''
was obtained. The observed rotation curve is symmetric. It is not perturbed in
the inner disk. For radii >50'' it shows a solid body rotation. We compare
these data with a numerical model which includes the effects of ram pressure
stripping. The model can reproduce the main characteristics of the H-alpha
emission distribution and velocity field. We therefore conclude that the
stripping event which caused the HI deficiency and the distorted H-alpha
distribution and velocity field has been due to ram pressure. The closest
passage of the galaxy to the cluster center is estimated to be approx. 6.5 10^8
yr ago. The observed recent star formation is due to the re-accretion of gas
clouds which were accelerated to velocities below the escape velocity during
the stripping event. Furthermore, the gas which is located at radii >60'' is
part of an asymmetric expanding ring of gas clouds. A substantial part of these
clouds is located above the disk plane. We predict the HI gas distribution and
velocity field as it would be observed by deep 21 cm observations.

rotation curves are studied in this work. We use our large, homogeneously
collected sample of 510 cluster spiral galaxy rotation curves to test the claim
that the shape of a galaxy's rotation curve strongly depends on its location
within the cluster, and thus presumably on the strength of the local
intracluster medium and on the frequency and strength of tidal interactions
with the cluster and cluster galaxies. Our data do not corroborate such a
scenario, consistent with the fact that Tully-Fisher residuals are independent
of galaxy location within the cluster; while the average late-type spiral
galaxy shows more rise in the outer parts of its rotation curve than does the
typical early-type spiral galaxy, there is no apparent trend for either subset
with cluster environment. We also investigate as a function of cluster
environment rotation curve asymmetry and the radial distribution of H II region
tracers within galactic disks. Mild trends with projected cluster-centric
distance are observed: (i) the (normalized) radial extent of optical line
emission averaged over all spiral galaxy types shows a 4%+/-2% increase per Mpc
of galaxy-cluster core separation, and (ii) rotation curve asymmetry falls by a
factor of two between the inner and outer cluster for early-type spirals (a
negligible decrease is found for late-type spirals). Such trends are consistent
with spiral disk perturbations or even the stripping of the diffuse, outermost
gaseous regions within the disks as galaxies pass through the dense cluster

curves of eclipsing binary stars, focussing mainly upon systems containing at
least one white dwarf component. In absolute terms the effects are small,
however they are strongest at the time of secondary eclipse when the white
dwarf transits its companion, and act to reduce the depth of this feature. If
not accounted for, this may lead to under-estimation of the radius of the white
dwarf compared to that of its companion. I show that the effect is significant
for plausible binary parameters, and that it leads to ~25% reduction in the
transit depth in the system KPD 1930+2752. The reduction of eclipse depth is
degenerate with the stellar radius ratio, and therefore cannot be used to
establish the existence of lensing. A second order effect of the light bending
is to steepen the ingress and egress features of the secondary eclipse relative
to the primary eclipse, although it will be difficult to see this in practice.
I consider also binaries containing neutron stars and black-holes. I conclude
that, although relatively large effects are possible in such systems, a
combination of rarity, faintness and intrinsic variability make it unlikely
that lensing will be detectable in them.

may be associated with the tail of the distribution of stellar companions, we
investigate a scenario in which 5 < N < 100 planetary mass objects are assumed
to form rapidly through a fragmentation process occuring in a disc or
protostellar envelope on a scale of 100 au.
  These are assumed to have formed rapidly enough through gravitational
instability or fragmentation that their orbits can undergo dynamical relaxation
on a timescale of about 100 orbits.
  Under a wide range of initial conditions and assumptions the relaxation
process ends with either (i) one potential 'hot Jupiter' plus up to two
'external' companions, i.e. planets orbiting near the outer edge of the initial
distribution; (ii) one or two 'external' planets or even none at all; (iii) one
planet on an orbit with a semi--major axis 10 to a 100 times smaller than the
outer boundary radius of the inital distribution together with an 'external'
companion. Most of the other objects are ejected and could contribute to a
population of free floating planets. Apart from the potential 'hot Jupiters',
all the bound objects are on highly eccentric orbits. We found that, apart from
the close orbiters, the probability of ending up with a planet orbiting at a
given distance from the central star increases with the distance. This is
because of the tendency of the relaxation process to lead to collisions with
the central star.
  We discuss the application of these results to some of the more massive
extrasolar planets.

dark matter onto the halo, the distribution of the cold dark matter particles

the period distribution below 1.558 ms. The search of these ultrafastly
spinning neutron stars as pulsars can help discriminating among the various
equations of state for nuclear matter, and can shed light into the physics of
binary evolution.
  The evolution of isolated neutron stars in the Galaxy is explored beyond the
pulsar phase. Moving through the tenuous interstellar medium, these old
solitary neutron stars lose their rotational energy. Whether also their
magnetism fades is still a mystery. A population synthesis model has revealed
that only a tiny fraction of them is able to accrete from the interstellar
medium, shining in the X-rays. There is the hope that these solitary stars will
eventually appear as faint sources in the Chandra sky survey. This might give
insight on the long term evolution of the magnetic field in isolated objects.

based on a liquid xenon time projection chamber with charge and light readout.
The energy and direction of an incident gamma-ray is reconstructed from the
three-dimensional locations and energy deposits of individual interactions
taking place in the homogeneous detector volume. While the charge signals
provide energy information and X-Y positions, the fast xenon scintillation
light signal is used to trigger the detector. The drift time measurement,
referred to the time of the trigger signal, gives the Z-position with the known
drift velocity. The light is detected by four UV-sensitive photomultiplier
tubes (PMTs). The logical OR of the PMT signals triggers the data acquisition
system with an efficiency which depends on the event energy and location, as
well as on the discriminator thresholds used on the individual PMTs. Results
from experiments with a tagged 22Na source give the spatial distribution of the
light trigger efficiency for 511 keV gamma-rays. When averaged over the whole
sensitive volume amd all PMTs, the trigger efficiency is 47% or 40% for two
discriminator windows used during the LXeGRIT balloon flight of 1999. These
values are strongly affected by the different sensitivity of each PMT. The
corresponding average efficiency at 511 keV for the best of the four PMTs is in
fact 63%, and approaches 100% for interactions taking place in a small volume
right above the PMT.

their afterglows are produced by highly relativistic jets emitted in
core-collapse explosions. The pre-explosive ambient medium provides a natural
test for the most likely progenitors of GRBs. Those stars that shed their
envelopes most readily have short jet crossing times and are more likely to
produce a GRB. We construct a simple computational scheme to explore the
expected contribution of the presupernova ejecta of single Wolf-Rayet (WR)
stars to the circumstellar environment. Using detailed stellar tracks for the
evolution of massive stars, we discuss the effects that the initial main
sequence mass, metallicity, rotation and membership in a binary system have on
the ambient medium. We extend the theory of GRB afterglows in winds to consider
the effect of the relativistic fireball propagating through the WR ejecta. We
make specific predictions for the interaction of the relativistic blast wave
with the density bumps that arise when the progenitor star rapidly loses a
large fraction of its initial mass or when the ejected wind interacts with the
external medium and decelerates. A re-brightening of the afterglow with a
spectrum redder than the typical synchrotron spectrum (as seen in GRB 970508,
GRB 980326 and GRB 000911) is predicted. We also calculate the luminosity of
the reflected echo that arises when circumstellar material Compton-scatters the
prompt radiation and examine the spectral signatures expected from the
interaction of the GRB afterglow with the ejected medium.

increased about threefold. The masing region is < 0.6 pc in radius. The flux
density of radio continuum emission from the core has been rising for about 2
years. The maser-core separation is barely resolved but at the 3 sigma
significance level they are not coincident along the line of sight. The masers
lie in the direction of the northern radio lobes and probably emanate from
material shocked by a jet with velocity close to c. The correlation between the

available. These heavy elements, or `metals', were not produced in the big
bang. They result from fusion inside stars and have been gradually building up
over the lifetime of the Universe. Recent observations indicate that the
presence of giant extrasolar planets at small distances from their host stars,
is strongly correlated with high metallicity of the host stars. The presence of
these close-orbiting giants is incompatible with the existence of earth-like
planets. Thus, there may be a Goldilocks selection effect: with too little
metallicity, earths are unable to form for lack of material, with too much
metallicity giant planets destroy earths. Here I quantify these effects and
obtain the probability, as a function of metallicity, for a stellar system to
harbour an earth-like planet. I combine this probability with current estimates
of the star formation rate and of the gradual build up of metals in the
Universe to obtain an estimate of the age distribution of earth-like planets in
the Universe. The analysis done here indicates that three quarters of the
earth-like planets in the Universe are older than the Earth and that their
average age is 1.8 +/- 0.9 billion years older than the Earth. If life forms
readily on earth-like planets - as suggested by the rapid appearance of life on
Earth - this analysis gives us an age distribution for life on such planets and
a rare clue about how we compare to other life which may inhabit the Universe.

Chandra/ACIS-S observation of the transient, type-I X-ray bursting low-mass
X-ray binary Cen X-4. The quiescent X-ray spectrum during this observation is
statistically identical to one observed previously with Beppo/SAX, and close,
but not identical, to one observed previously with ASCA. The X-ray spectrum is
best described as a pure Hydrogen atmosphere thermal spectrum plus a power-law
component that dominates the spectrum above 2 keV. The best-fit radius of the
neutron star is r=12.9+/-2.6 (d/1.2 kpc) km if the interstellar absorption is
fixed at the value implied by the optical reddening. Allowing the interstellar
absorption to be a free parameter yields r=19+45-10 (d/1.2 kpc) km (90%
confidence). The thermal spectrum from the neutron star surface is inconsistent
with a solar metallicity. We find a 3sigma upper-limit of root-mean-square
variability <18% (0.2-2.0 keV; 0.0001-1 Hz) during the observation. On the
other hand, the 0.5-10.0 keV luminosity decreased by 40+/-8% in the 4.9 years
between the Asca and Chandra observations. This variability can be attributed
to the power-law component. Moreover, we limit the variation in thermal
temperature to <10% over these 4.9 years. The stability of the thermal
temperature and emission area radius supports the interpretation that the
quiescent thermal emission is due to the hot neutron star core.

angular distribution of TeV gamma-rays during the 1997 burst phase -- where
direct photons should dominate -- with the distribution during the 1998/99

pronounced. The results depend on the assumptions concerning the angular

critically. The average (equipartition) strength of the total field derived
from radio synchrotron data is 6 +/- 2 muG locally and about 10 +/- 3 muG at 3
kpc Galactic radius. These values agree well with the estimates using the
locally measured cosmic-ray energy spectrum and the radial variation of protons
derived from gamma-rays. Optical and synchrotron polarization data yield a
strength of the local regular field of 4 +/- 1 muG, but this value is an upper
limit if the field strength fluctuates within the beam or if anisotropic fields
are present. Pulsar rotation measures, on the other hand, give only 1.4 +/- 0.2
muG, a lower limit if fluctuations in regular field strength and thermal
electron density are anticorrelated along the pathlength. The local regular
field may be part of a 'magnetic arm' between the optical arms. However, the
global structure of the regular Galactic field is not yet known. Several
large-scale field reversals in the Galaxy were detected from rotation measure
data, but a similar phenomenon was not observed in external galaxies. The
Galactic field may be young in terms of dynamo action so that reversals from
the chaotic seed field are preserved, or a mixture of dynamo modes causes the
reversals, or the reversals are signatures of large-scale anisotropic field
loops. The Galaxy is surrounded by a thick disk of radio continuum emission of
similar extent as in edge-on spiral galaxies. While the local field in the thin
disk is of even symmetry with respect to the plane (quadrupole), the global
thick-disk field may be of dipole type. The Galactic center region hosts highly
regular fields of up to milligauss strength which are oriented perpendicular to
the plane.

argue that the combination of these signatures provides a sensitive probe of an
environmental shock wave. Analysis of optical redshifts in NGC 315 vicinity
confirms its location to be near, or at a site of large-scale flow collisions
in the 100 Mpc sized Pisces-Perseus Supercluster region. NGC 315 resides at the
intersection of several galaxy filaments, and its radio plasma serves there as
a `weather station' (Burns 1998) probing the flow of the elusive and previously
invisible IGM gas. If our interpretation is correct, this is the first
indication for a shock wave in flows caused by the cosmological large scale
structure formation, which is located in a filament of galaxies. The
possibility that the putative shock wave is a source of gamma-rays and ultra
high energy cosmic rays is briefly discussed.

GRO J1655-40 and in low mass X-ray binaries is discussed. It is shown that
spectral analysis strongly constrains emission models. Measurement of dip
ingress/egress times allows the sizes of extended emission regions to be
determined, notably for the Accretion Disk Corona which is responsible for
Comptonization in X-ray binaries. In LMXB, the radius of the ADC is shown to be
between ~ 10^9 and ~ 5x10^10 cm, an appreciable fraction of the accretion disk
radius. This is inconsistent with Comptonization models requiring a localized
Comptonizing region, for example, in the immediate neighbourhood of the neutron
star. Results from a survey of LMXB using ASCA and BeppoSAX reveal an
approximate equality between the height of the blackbody emission region on the
neutron star and the height of the inner radiatively-supported disk, suggesting
either that there is a direct causal link, such as a radial accretion flow
between the inner disk edge and the star, or an indirect link, as in the case
of accretion flow creep on the surface of the neutron star as suggested by
Inogamov & Sunyaev. Finally, the survey shows that the blackbody cannot
originate on the accretion disk as the required inner radii in many sources are
substantially less than the neutron star radius.

detected weakly only in the larger aperture spectrum. We also report the first
detection of C II 1037 emission in a supernova remnant. The spectra show the
presence of two kinematic components along the line of sight - one with both
low and high excitation emission centered at a velocity of -50 km/s and another
with only low excitation emission centered at a velocity of +100 km/s. We
associate the -50 km/s component with the observed X-ray knot, and find a
dynamical pressure of 3.7x10^{-10} dyne cm^{-2} driving the shock. We compare
our results with data obtained using the Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope at
nearby locations and find that differences in the spectra imply the existence
of two emitting components in the X-ray knot. Based on the X-ray morphology
seen in a ROSAT HRI image, we identify two distinct regions which can be
associated with these two components whose ultraviolet emission differs
dramatically. These observations demonstrate the importance of high spectral
resolution in understanding the proper physical relationships between the
various emitting components in supernova remnants.

Bank and Parkes show that it is young, with a characteristic age of 350 kyr,
and is in a 231-day, highly eccentric orbit with a companion whose mass exceeds
11 M_sun. An accurate position for the pulsar was obtained using the Australia
Telescope Compact Array. Near-infrared 2.2-um observations make with the
telescopes at the Siding Spring observatory reveal a late-type star coincident
with the pulsar position. However, we do not believe that this star is the
pulsar's companion, because a typical star of this spectral type and required
mass would extend beyond the pulsar's orbit. Furthermore, the measured advance
of periastron of the pulsar suggests a more compact companion, for example, a
main-sequence star with radius only a few times that of the sun. Such a
companion is also more consistent with the small dispersion measure variations
seen near periastron. Although we cannot conclusively rule out a black-hole
companion, we believe the companion is probably an early B star, making the
system similar to the binary PSR J0045-7319.

galaxies (15.5>bj>18.0 or -16>Mb>-13.5). Halpha emission shows that 36+/-8 per
cent of the dwarfs are star-forming, twice the fraction implied by
morphological classifications. The total sample has a mean velocity of
1493+/-36 km/s and a velocity dispersion of 374+/-26 km/s. The dwarf galaxies
form a distinct population: their velocity dispersion (429+/-41 km/s) is larger

subcluster centered 3 degrees to the south-west including NGC 1316 with mean

preferred over a single cluster at the 99 per cent confidence level. The
subcluster, a site of intense star formation, is bound to Fornax and probably
infalling towards the cluster core for the first time. We discuss the
implications of this substructure for distance estimates of the Fornax Cluster.

strongly motivated by modern high-energy physics theories. Comparison of quasar
absorption line spectra with laboratory spectra provides a sensitive probe for
variability of the fine structure constant, alpha, over cosmological
time-scales. We have previously developed and applied a new method providing an
order of magnitude gain in precision over previous optical astrophysical
constraints. Here we extend that work by including new quasar spectra of damped
Lyman-alpha absorption systems. We also re-analyse our previous lower redshift
data and confirm our initial results. The constraints on alpha come from
simultaneous fitting of absorption lines of subsets of the following species:
Mg I, Mg II, Al II, Al III, Si II, Cr II, Fe II, Ni II and Zn II. We present a
detailed description of our methods and results based on an analysis of 49
quasar absorption systems (towards 28 QSOs) covering the redshift range 0.5 < z
< 3.5. There is statistical evidence for a smaller alpha at earlier epochs:
da/a = (-0.72 +/- 0.18) * 10^{-5}. The new and original samples are independent
but separately yield consistent and significant non-zero values of da/a. We
summarise the results of a thorough investigation of systematic effects
published in a companion paper. The value we quote above is the raw value, not
corrected for any of these systematic effects. The only significant systematic
effects so far identified, if removed from our data, would lead to a more
significant deviation of da/a from zero.

Detection of high redshift absorption systems intersecting the sight lines
towards distant quasars provide a powerful tool for measuring these variations.
In the present paper we demonstrate that high sensitivity to variation of the
fine structure constant alpha can be obtained by comparing cosmic and
laboratory spectra of the Ni II ion. Relativistic effects in Ni II reveal many
interesting features. The Ni II spectrum exhibits avoided level crossing
phenomenon under variation of alpha and the intervals between the levels have
strong nonlinear dependencies on relativistic corrections. The values of the
transition frequency shifts, due to the change of alpha, vary significantly
from state to state including change of the sign. This enhances the sensitivity
to the variation of alpha and reduces possible systematic errors. The
calculations of alpha-dependence of the nickel ion spectral lines that are
detectable in quasar absorption spectra have been performed using a
relativistic configuration interaction method.

imaging and FOS spectroscopy. The ionised gas central velocity dispersion is
found to increase by a factor ~2 when narrowing the aperture from R~1.5""
(ground) to R~0.1"" (FOS). Dynamical modeling of these velocity dispersions
suggests that NGC 2681 does host a supermassive black hole (BH) for which one
can estimate a firm mass upper limit M_BH < 6*10^7 Solar Masses. This upper
limit is consistent with the relation between the central BH mass and velocity
dispersion M_BH - sigma known for other galaxies. The emission line ratios
place the nucleus of NGC 2681 among LINERs. It is likely that the emission line
region comes from a rather mild, but steady, feeding of gas to the central BH
in this galaxy. The inner stellar population lacks any measurable color
gradient (to a radius of 0.6 kpc) from the infrared to the ultraviolet,
consistently with FOC, FOS and IUE data, all indicating that this system
underwent a starburst ~1 Gyr ago that encompassed its whole interior, down to
its very center. The most likely source of such a widely-distributed starburst
is the dumping of tidally-extruded gas from a galaxy neighbor. If so, then NGC
2681 can be considered as the older brother of M82, seen face-on as opposed to
the edge-on view we have for M82.

have been observed with the VLA at 1.365, 1.665, 4.535, 4.985, 8.085, 8.485,
14.96 and 22.46 GHz in order to derive a simultaneous radio spectrum, and
remove variable sources from the sample. The final list of genuine HFP sources
consists of 55 objects with flux density exceeding 300 mJy at 4.9 GHz at the

them; 24 are high redshift quasars, 3 are galaxies (one of them has indeed
broad lines in the optical spectrum) and 2 are BL Lac objects. The remaining

necessary to consider the effect of it differential rotation, because viscosity
is not strong enough for differentially rotating young neutron stars to be lead
to uniformly rotating configurations on a very short time scale after their

extended version of the method which was applied to compute r-mode oscillations
of uniformly rotating Newtonian polytropic stars. By using this new method, we
have succeeded in obtaining eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of r-mode
oscillations of differentially rotating polytropic stars. Our numerical results
show that as the degree of differential rotation is increased, it becomes more
difficult to solve r-mode oscillations for slightly deformed configurations
from sphere compared to solving r-mode oscillations of considerably deformed
stars. One reason for it seems that for slightly deformed stars corotation
points appear near the surface region if the degree of differential rotation is
strong enough. This is similar to the situation that the perturbational
approach of r-mode oscillations for it slowly rotating stars in general
relativity results in a singular eigenvalue problem.

frame of the clumps being evaporated, while in others it is everywhere greater
than unity. In some solutions the mass-loaded shocked wind undergoes one or two
sonic transitions in the clump frame. Maximum possible values of the ratio of
evaporated mass to stellar wind mass are found as a consequence of the

radial accretion flow in the disc. We also introduce a vertical magnetic flux
through the galactic midplane, to simulate the presence of a large scale
magnetic field trapped by the galaxy when forming. The trapped vertical flux is
conserved and advected towards the disc centre by the radial flow. We confirm
that accretion flows of magnitude several km/s through a significant part of
the galactic disc can markedly inhibit dynamo action. Moreover, advection of
the vertical flux in general results in mixed parity galactic fields. However,
the effect is nonlinear and non-additive -- global magnetic field energies are
usually significantly smaller that the sum of purely dynamo generated and
purely advected field energies. For large inflow speeds, a form of
`semi-dynamo' action may occur.
  We apply our results to the accumulation and redistribution, by a radial
inflow, of a vertical magnetic flux captured by the Galactic disc. Taking
representative values, it appears difficult to obtain mean vertical fields near
the centre of the Milky Way that are much in excess of 10 microgauss, largely
because the galactic dynamo and turbulent magnetic diffusion modify the
external magnetic field before it can reach the disc centre.

world models consisting of up to four non-interacting fluids, each with
pressure P, energy density epsilon and an equation of state P = (gamma - 1)
epsilon with 0 <= gamma <= 2.
  In addition to repulsive fluids with negative pressure and positive energy
density, which generalize the classical repulsive (positive) Lambda component,
we consider fluids with negative energy density as well. The latter generalize
a negative Lambda component. This renders possible new types of models that do
not occur among the classical classifications of world models. Singularity-free
periodic solutions as well as further `hill-type', `hollow-type' and
`shifting-type' models are feasible.
  However, if one only allows for three components (dust, radiation and one
repulsive component) in a spatially flat universe the repulsive classical
Lambda fluid (with Lambda > 0) tends to yield the smoothest fits of the
Supernova Ia data from Perlmutter et al. (1999). Adopting the SN Ia
constraints, exotic negative energy density components can be fittingly
included only if the universe consists of four or more fluids.

permeating the jet and the ambient medium; and (iii) a purely toroidal field

is not very much affected by the presence of the different magnetic field
geometries in comparison to a nonmagnetic calculation. Instead, the magnetic
fields tend to affect essentially the detailed structure and emission
properties behind the shocks at the head and at the pulse-induced internal
knots, particularly for the helical and toroidal geometries. In these cases, we
find, for example, that the $H_\alpha$ emissivity behind the internal knots can
be about three to four times larger than that of the purely hydrodynamical jet.

confirm a rise in variability amplitude with redshift, nor do we see any

flux ratio range spanning a factor of 60,000 from radio-quiet to extreme
radio-loud objects is largely constant, although there is a suggestion of

turbulence with a magnetic Prandtl number $Pr \geq 1$. We examine the processes
by which an initially weak, large-scale seed magnetic field and an initially
weak, small-scale, impulse-like seed magnetic field are amplified. We find that
in both cases the magnetic energy spectrum grows at all scales. The growth
rates at different amplification stages are analyzed. For a large-scale seed
magnetic field, the magnetic energy density grows as $\sim t^2$ for the first
few turbulence eddy turnover times, followed by a dynamic growth stage, where
nonlinear interactions between different scales of the turbulence contribute to
an exponential growth rate that is largely determined by the turbulence eddy
turnover time. For a seed magnetic field that is initially set up at a small
scale in the turbulence, during the kinematic development stage, the growth
rate of magnetic energy is $\propto 1/\tau_{max}$, where $\tau_{max}$ is the
eddy turnover time of the smallest eddies of the turbulence. The kinematic
growth stage is followed by a dynamic growth stage, where nonlinearity plays
important role. During such dynamic growth stage, the growth rate of total
magnetic energy is determined by both the magnetic energy amplification within
the turbulence inertial range and that within the turbulence dissipation range.

commonly observed. The power-density spectra show a pseudo power-law form with
a turnover at low frequencies and a high frequency break, similar to galactic
black-hole candidates. There have been a few claims for periodicities but these
are not a well-established property of the class. The amplitude of variability
depends on a number of source parameters, including luminosity and spectral
properties. The variability amplitude is correlated with X-ray spectral index,
and anti-correlated with the width of the permitted optical lines. In one
particularly well-observed case, NGC 7469, we see a relationship between the
X-ray and UV variability, which indicates that the dominant emission process
for the X-rays is thermal Comptonization. Variations in the X-ray emission are
related to changes in the UV seed photons, but it appears there must also be a
mechanism - perhaps that which heats the Comptonizing corona - that induces
rapid variability intrinsic to the X-rays.

stripe centered on the Celestial Equator covering $\sim529$ square degrees.
Positions and SDSS magnitudes are given for the 898 quasars known prior to SDSS
spectroscopic commissioning. New SDSS quasars represent an increase of over
200% in the number of known quasars in this area of the sky. The ensemble
average of the observed colors of quasars in the SDSS passbands are well
represented by a power-law continuum with $\alpha_{\nu} = -0.5$ ($f_{\nu}
\propto \nu^{\alpha}$). However, the contributions of the $3000 {\rm \AA}$ bump
and other strong emission lines have a significant effect upon the colors. The
color-redshift relation exhibits considerable structure, which may be of use in
determining photometric redshifts for quasars. The range of colors can be
accounted for by a range in the optical spectral index with a distribution
$\alpha_{\nu}=-0.5\pm0.65$ (95% confidence), but there is a red tail in the
distribution. This tail may be a sign of internal reddening. Finally, we show
that there is a continuum of properties between quasars and Seyfert galaxies
and we test the validity of the traditional division between the two classes of
AGN.

protostellar accretion disk around intermediate mass stars via 2D numerical
simulations. Using three different detailed dust models, compact spherical
particles, fractal BPCA grains, and BCCA grains, we find that even during the
early collapse and the first 10,000 yr of dynamical disk evolution, the initial
dust size distribution is strongly modified. Close to the disk's midplane
coagulation produces dust particles of sizes of several 10 micons (for compact
spherical grains) up to several mm (for fluffy BCCA grains), whereas in the
vicinity of the accretion shock front (located several density scale heights
above the disk), large velocity differences inhibit coagulation. Dust particles
larger than about 1 micron segregate from the smaller grains behind the
accretion shock. Due to the combined effects of coagulation and grain
segregation the infrared dust emission is modified. Throughout the accretion
disk a MRN dust distribution provides a poor description of the general dust
properties. Estimates of the consequences of the ""freezing out"" of molecules in
protostellar disks should consider strongly modified grains. Physical model
parameters such as the limiting sticking strength and the grains' resistivity
against shattering are crucial factors determining the degree of coagulation
reached. In dense regions (e.g. in the mid-plane of the disk) a steady-state is
quickly attained. High above the equatorial plane coagulation equilibrium is
not reached due to the much lower densities. Here, the dust size distribution
is affected primarily by differential advection, rather than coagulation.

of early-type galaxies in two distant regions. Here we describe the maximum
likelihood algorithm we developed to investigate the correlations between the
parameters of the EFAR database. One-, two-, and three-dimensional gaussian
models are constructed to determine the mean value and intrinsic spread of the
parameters, and the slopes and intrinsic parallel and orthogonal spread of the
Mgb'-Mg2, Mg2-sigma, Mgb'-sigma relations, and the Fundamental Plane. In the
latter case, the cluster peculiar velocities are also determined. We show that
this method is superior to ``canonical'' approaches of least-squares type,
which give biased slopes and biased peculiar velocities. We test the algorithm
with Monte Carlo simulations of mock EFAR catalogues and derive the systematic
and random errors on the estimated parameters. We find that random errors are
always dominant. We estimate the influence of systematic errors due to the way
clusters were selected and the hard limits and uncertainties in the selection
function parameters for the galaxies. We explore the influence of uniform
distributions in the Fundamental Plane parameters and the errors. We conclude
that the mean peculiar motions of the EFAR clusters can be determined reliably.
In particular, the placement of the two EFAR sample regions relative to the
Lauer and Postman dipole allows us to strongly constrain the amplitude of the
bulk motion in this direction.

indicating that this small mass cluster is chemically very homogenous. On the
other side, our results show clearly and for the first time that the O-Na
anticorrelation (up to now seen only for stars on the red giant branches of
globular clusters) is present among unevolved stars in the globular cluster
NGC6752, a more massive cluster than NGC6397. A similar anticorrelation is
present also for Mg and Al, and C and N. It is very difficult to explain the
observed Na-O, and Mg-Al anticorrelation in NGC6752 stars by a deep mixing

profile of the disk follows the expected T ~R^3/4 only in the outer parts and
flattens off inside 0.5 times the white dwarf Roche lobe radius. The single
peaked emission lines originate in a region above the plane of the disk, at the
position of the hot spot.

radiation pressure in circumstellar gas disks, which are in a transitional
stage between the gas-dominated, optically thick, primordial nebulae, and the
dust-dominated, optically thin Vega-type disks. Dust undergo radial migration,
seeking a stable equilibrium orbit in corotation with gas. The migration of
dust gives rise to radial fractionation of dust and creates a variety of
possible observed disk morphologies, which we compute by considering the
equilibrium between the dust production and the dust-dust collisions removing
particles from their equilibrium orbits. Sand-sized and larger grains are
distributed throughout most of the gas disk, with concentration near the gas
pressure maximum in the inner disk. Smaller grains (typically in the range of
10 to 200 micron) concentrate in a prominent ring structure in the outer region
of the gas disk (presumably at radius 100 AU), where gas density is rapidly
declining with radius. The width and density, as well as density contrast of
the dust ring with respect to the inner dust disk depend on the distribution of
gas. Our results open the prospect for deducing the distribution of gas in
circumstellar disks by observing their dust. We have qualitatively compared our
models with two observed transitional disks around HR 4796A and HD 141569A.
Dust migration can result in observation of a ring or a bimodal radial dust
distribution, possibly very similar to the ones produced by gap-opening
planet(s) embedded in the disk, or shepherding it from inside or outside. We
conclude that a convincing planet detection via dust imaging should include
specific non-axisymmetric structure following from the dynamical simulations of
perturbed disks.

  Lewis",Presolar Grains from Novae,"20 pages, 5 figures, 1 table. ApJ, in press",,10.1086/320235,,astro-ph,,"  We report the discovery of five SiC grains and one graphite grain isolated
from the Murchison carbonaceous meteorite whose major-element isotopic
compositions indicate an origin in nova explosions. The grains are
characterized by low 12C/13C (4-9) and 14N/15N (5-20) ratios, large excesses in
30Si (30Si/28Si ratios range to 2.1 times solar) and high 26Al/27Al ratios.
These isotopic signatures are theoretically predicted for the ejecta from ONe
novae and cannot be matched by any other stellar sources. Previous studies of
presolar grains from primitive meteorites have shown that the vast majority
formed in red giant outflows and supernova ejecta. Although a classical nova
origin was suggested for a few presolar graphite grains on the basis of 22Ne
enrichments, this identification is somewhat ambiguous since it is based only
on one trace element. Our present study presents the first evidence for nova
grains on the basis of major element isotopic compositions of single grains. We
also present the results of nucleosynthetic calculations of classical nova
models and compare the predicted isotopic ratios with those of the grains. The
comparison points toward massive ONe novae if the ejecta are mixed with
material of close-to-solar composition.

astro-ph/0012466,Alice C. Quillen,A. C. Quillen (Steward Observatory),The Capture of Particles by Chaotic Resonances During Orbital Migration,will be submitted to AJ,,,,astro-ph,,"  Because a chaotic zone can reduce the long timescale capture probabilities
and cause catastrophic events such as close encounters with a planet or star
during temporary capture, the dynamics of migrating planets is likely to be
strongly dependent on the widths of the resonance chaotic zones. Previous
theoretical work on the resonant capture of particles into mean-motion
resonances by orbital migration has been restricted to the study of integrable
models. By exploring toy drifting Hamiltonian models we illustrate how the
structure in phase space of a resonance can be used to generalize this
integrable capture theory to include the richer phenomenology of chaotic
resonances. We show that particles are temporarily captured into the chaotic
zone of a resonance with fixed shape for a time that is given by the width of
the chaotic zone divided by the resonance drift rate. Particles can be
permanently captured into a drifting chaotic resonance only if they are
captured into a growing integrable region. Therefore resonances containing wide
chaotic zones have lower permanent capture probabilities than those lacking
chaotic zones. We expect large deviations from the predictions of integrable
capture theories when the chaotic zone is large and the migration rate is
sufficiently long that many Lyapunov times pass while particles are temporarily
captured in the resonance. The 2:1 mean-motion resonance with Neptune in the
Kuiper Belt contains a chaotic zone, even when integrated on short timescales
such as a million years. Capture probabilities are lower than estimated
previously from drifting integrable models. This may offer an explanation for
low eccentricity Kuiper Belt objects between 45-47 AU which should have been
previously captured in the 2:1 resonance by Neptune's migration.

address this question by comparing -- simultaneously -- the properties of the
collection of heterogeneously selected samples that are available now, with the
predictions of a set of plausible unifications scenarios. We show that it is
already possible to make significant progress even by using only the present
samples. The important role of selection effects is discussed. For instance we
show that the multiple flux selections typical of available surveys could
induce some of the correlations found in color-color diagrams. These latter

  Two different mass-functions are studied: A gaussian initial distribution in

galactic globular cluster system, and a power-law distribution resembling what
is seen for clusters in merging and interacting galaxies. We find that in the
inner parts of the galaxy, both distributions evolve in such a way that they
are consistent with the observations. In the outer parts, a gaussian initial
distribution gives the better fit. This might change however if elliptic orbits
are considered, or there are undiscovered low-mass clusters in the galactic
halo. In any case, only a small fraction of the stellar halo of the Milky Way
originated in globular clusters.

field, the rotational energy of the Kerr black hole provides an energy source
for the radiation of the disk in addition to disk accretion. The black hole
exerts a torque on the disk, which transfers energy and angular momentum
between the black hole and the disk. If the black hole rotates faster than the
disk, energy and angular momentum are extracted from the black hole and
transfered to the disk. The energy deposited into the disk is eventually
radiated away by the disk, which will increase the efficiency of the disk. If
the black hole rotates slower than the disk, energy and angular momentum are
transfered from the disk to the black hole, which will lower the efficiency of
the disk. With suitable boundary conditions, quasi-steady state solutions are
obtained for a thin Keplerian disk magnetically coupled to a Kerr black hole.
By ``quasi-steady state'' we mean that any macroscopic quantity at a given
radius in the disk slowly changes with time: the integrated change within one
rotation period of the disk is much smaller than the quantity itself. We find
that, the torque produced by the magnetic coupling propagates only outward in
the disk, the total radiation flux of the disk is a superposition of the
radiation flux produced by the magnetic coupling and that produced by
accretion. Most interestingly, a disk magnetically coupled to a rapidly
rotating black hole can radiate without accretion. Such a disk has an infinite
efficiency. For a specific example that the magnetic field touches the disk at
the inner boundary, the radial radiation profile is very different from that of
a standard accretion disk: the emissivity index is significantly bigger, most
radiation comes from a region which is closer to the center of the disk.

homogeneous turbulence in a slab between open boundaries. It is found that a
`pseudo-vacuum' boundary condition (where the field is vertical) leads to
strong helicity fluxes which significantly reduce the amplitude of the
resulting large scale field. On the other hand, if there is a conducting halo
outside the dynamo-active region the large scale field amplitude can reach
larger values, but the time scale after which this field is reached increases
linearly with the magnetic Reynolds number. In both cases most of the helicity
flux is found to occur on large scales. From the variety of models considered
we conclude that open boundaries tend to lower the saturation field strength
compared to the case with periodic boundaries. The rate at which this lower
saturation field strength is attained is roughly independent of the strength of
the turbulence and of the boundary conditions. For dynamos with less helicity,
however, significant field strengths could be reached in a shorter time.

during active accretion states is low and only slightly variable in the range
5000-8000A. However, the polarization is highly structured with wavelength,
showing very broad polarization humps, narrow features that are associated with
weak absorption lines in the total spectral flux, and sharp reversals across
each major emission line. The polarization reversals arise from Zeeman
splitting in the funnel gas in a longitudinal magnetic field B~30kG. The set of
narrow, polarized absorption features matches the Zeeman pattern of hydrogen
for a nearly uniform magnetic field of B=150MG, indicating that the features
are ""halo"" absorption lines formed in a relatively cool reversing layer above
the shock. With this identification, the broad polarization humps centered near

configurations are appropriately perturbed and are numerically evolved using an

thin disks using global 2D hydrodynamic simulations. The key questions we are
addressing in this paper are: (1) What happens when the instability becomes
nonlinear? Specifically, does it lead to vortex formation? (2) What is the
detailed behavior of a vortex? (3) Can the instability sustain itself and can
the vortex last a long time? Among various initial equilibria that we have
examined, we generally find that there are three stages of the disk evolution:
(1) The exponential growth of the initial small amplitude perturbations. This
is in excellent agreement with the linear theory; (2) The production of large
scale vortices and their interactions with the background flow, including
shocks. Significant accretion is observed due to these vortices. (3) The
coupling of Rossby waves/vortices with global spiral waves, which facilitates
further accretion throughout the whole disk. Even after more than 20
revolutions at the radius of vortices, we find that the disk maintains a state
that is populated with vortices, shocks, spiral waves/shocks, all of which
transport angular momentum outwards. We elucidate the physics at each stage and
show that there is an efficient outward angular momentum transport in stages
(2) and (3) over most parts of the disk, with an $\alpha$ in the range from
$10^{-4}$ to $10^{-2}$. We show why such vortices prove to be almost ideal
``units'' in transporting angular momentum outwards, namely by positively
correlating the radial and azimuthal velocity components. We find some special
cases in which entropy can remain the same while angular momentum is
transported. We conclude that Rossby wave/vortex instability is an efficient,
purely hydrodynamic mechanism for angular momentum transport in thin disks.

NGC 1808 and NGC 5728), the velocity dispersion displays a significant drop at
the nucleus, a rarely observed phenomenon. We also detect kinematical
asymmetries (m=1 mode) along the nuclear bar major-axis of NGC 1808 and NGC
5728, dynamical counterparts of corresponding asymmetries in the surface
brightness. We have derived simple dynamical models in an attempt to fit the
kinematics of each galaxy and reconstruct the full velocity field. For all four
targets, the fits are good, and confirm the presence of the decoupled nuclear
components. These models cannot however reproduce the observed central drop in
the dispersion. We suggest that this drop is due to a transient cold nuclear
disc, fuelled by gas inflow along the bar, that has recently formed new stars.

diffuse, and the remaining 30% is resolved into 49 discrete sources. Most of
the discrete sources associated with the galaxy appear to be low mass X-ray
binaries (LMXBs). The luminosity function of the LMXB sources is well-fit by a
broken power-law with a break luminosity comparable to the Eddington luminosity
for a 1.4 solar mass neutron star. It is likely that those sources with
luminosities above the break are accreting black holes and those below are
mostly neutron stars in binary systems. Spectra were extracted for the total
emission, diffuse emission, and sum of the resolved sources; the spectral fits
for all require a model including both a soft and hard component. The diffuse
emission is predominately soft while the emission from the sources is mostly
hard. Approximately 24% of the diffuse emission arises from unresolved LMXBs,
with the remainder resulting from thermal emission from hot gas. There is a
very bright source at the projected position of the nucleus of the galaxy. The
spectrum and luminosity derived from this central source are consistent with it
being an AGN; the galaxy also is a weak radio source. Finally, the diffuse
emission exhibits significant substructure with an intriguing spiral feature
passing through the center of the galaxy. The X-ray spectrum and surface
brightness of the spiral feature are consistent with adiabatic or shock
compression of ambient gas, but not with cooling. This feature may be due to
compression of the hot interstellar gas by radio lobes or jets associated with
the AGN.

photometry in order to construct spectral energy distributions for all detected
sources. The main scientific goals were to investigate the nature of the young
stellar objects (YSOs) in the cluster, and to examine the efficiency of
detecting circumstellar disk sources from near-infrared JHKL color-color
diagrams. Out of 59 sources surveyed having K-band magnitudes K < 10.5, we
detected 35 (~59%) at 10 um. Combining these detections, and upper limits for
the non-detections, with existing JHKL data, we identify 1 Class I, 6 flat
spectrum, 28 Class II and 5 Class III sources. We find a circumstellar disk
fraction for NGC 2024 of ~85% +/- 15%, which confirms earlier published
suggestions that the majority, if not all, of the stars in NGC 2024 formed with
disks, and these disks still exist at the present time. In addition, all but
one of the disk sources identified in our survey lie in the infrared excess
region of the JHKL color-color diagram for the cluster. This demonstrates that
JHKL color-color diagrams are extremely efficient in identifying YSOs with
disks. Of the 14 sources with K - L colors suggestive of protostellar objects,
\~29% are protostellar in nature, while ~7% are true Class I YSOs. This may be
due to extinction producing very red K - L colors in Class II YSOs, thus making
them appear similar in color to protostars. This suggests caution must be
applied when estimating the sizes and lifetimes of protostellar populations
within star forming regions based on K - L colors alone. Finally, we calculate
the luminosities of the Class II YSOs in NGC 2024, rho Oph and Taurus and
discuss the results.

  figs (.jpg)",,10.1063/1.1351827,,astro-ph,,"  (abridged) The interpretation of Faraday rotation measure maps of AGNs within
galaxy clusters has revealed regions, $\sim 50-100$ kpc, that are populated
with large, $\sim 30 \mu$ G magnetic fields. The magnetic energy of these
coherent regions is $\sim 10^{59-60}$ ergs, and the total magnetic energy over
the whole cluster ($\sim 1$ Mpc across) is expected to be even larger. A
sequence of physical processes that are responsible for the production,
redistribution and dissipation of these magnetic fields is proposed. These
fields are associated with single AGNs within the cluster and therefore with
all galaxies during their AGN phase, simply because only the central
supermassive black holes ($\sim 10^8 M_{\odot}$) have an accessible energy,
$\sim 10^{61}$ ergs. We propose an $\alpha-\Omega$ dynamo process in an
accretion disk. The disk rotation naturally provides a large winding number,
$\sim 10^{11}$ turns, sufficient to make both large gain and large flux. The
helicity of the dynamo can be generated by the differential plume rotation
derived from star-disk collisions. This helicity generation process has been
demonstrated in the laboratory and the dynamo gain was simulated numerically. A
liquid sodium analog of the dynamo is being built. Speculations are that the
back reaction of the saturated dynamo will lead to the formation of a
force-free magnetic helix, which will carry the energy and flux of the dynamo
away from the accretion disk and redistribute the field within the clusters and
galaxy walls. The magnetic reconnection of a small fraction of this energy
logically is the source of the AGN luminosity, and the remainder of the field
energy should then dominate the free energy of the present-day universe.

ratio as a function of galaxy luminosity at low redshift. We find that the
observed [O II]/Halpha ratio varies by a factor of 7 at luminosities near M_B*.
The [O II]/Halpha ratio is inversely correlated with luminosity. The scatter in
the [O II]/Halpha ratio and the dependence of the ratio on luminosity are due
in equal parts to reddening and to the metallicity dependent excitation of the
ISM. The uncertainty in star formation rates derived from [O II] fluxes is
therefore large. If Halpha cannot be observed, high S/N Hbeta fluxes are much
preferable to [O II] fluxes for deriving star formation rates. We present
several purely empirical corrections for extinction.

rotating K dwarf. We observed chromospheric (Mg II) and transition region (C
II, Si IV, C IV, and N V) lines periodically throughout the stellar rotation
period, and provide a low dispersion stellar atlas of 78 emission lines. The
quiescent line profiles of the chromospheric and transition region lines show
narrow cores superposed on very broad wings. The broad wings of the Mg II k & h
lines and of the transition region lines can be explained by emission from gas
co-rotating with the star and extending out to near the Keplerian co-rotation
radius (2.8 stellar radii). While this is not a unique solution, it is
consistent with previous studies of H-alpha emission that are naturally
explained by large co-rotating prominences. We find no evidence for rotational
modulation of the emission line fluxes. The density diagnostics suggest that
the transition region is formed at constant pressure, with an electron density
2-3 E12 /cm^3 at a temperature of 30,000 K. The electron pressure is about 100

nova EX Dra through its outburst cycle with eclipse mapping techniques. The
eclipse maps show evidence of the formation of a one-armed spiral structure in
the disc at the early stages of the outburst and reveal how the disc expands
during the rise until it fills most of the primary Roche lobe at maximum light.
The eclipse maps also suggest the presence of an inward and an outward-moving
heating wave during the rise and an inward-moving cooling wave in the decline.
Our results suggest a systematic deceleration of both the heating and the
cooling waves as they travel across the disc, in agreement with predictions of
the disc instability model. The analysis of the brightness temperature profiles
indicates that most of the disc appears to be in steady-state during quiescence
and at outburst maximum, but not during the intermediate stages. As a general
trend, the mass accretion rate in the outer regions is larger than in the inner
disc on the rising branch, while the opposite holds during the decline branch.
We estimate a mass accretion rate of Mdot= 10^{-8} Msun/yr at outburst maximum
and Mdot= 10^{-9.1} Msun/yr in quiescence. The brightness temperature profile
in quiescence also suggests that the viscosity parameter is high at this stage
which favours the mass-transfer instability model. The uneclipsed light has a
steady component, understood in terms of emission from the red secondary star,
and a variable component that is proportional to the out of eclipse flux and
corresponds to about 3 per cent of the total brightness of the system. The
variable component is interpreted as arising in a disc wind.

background magnetic field. Our major conclusions are: 1) MHD turbulence is most
conveniently described in terms of counter propagating shear Alfven and slow
waves. Shear Alfven waves control the cascade dynamics. Slow waves play a
passive role and adopt the spectrum set by the shear Alfven waves, as does a
passive scalar. 2) MHD turbulence is anisotropic with energy cascading more
rapidly along k_perp than along k_parallel, where k_perp and k_parallel refer
to wavevector components perpendicular and parallel to the local magnetic
field. Anisotropy increases with increasing k_perp. 3) MHD turbulence is
generically strong in the sense that the waves which comprise it suffer order
unity distortions on timescales comparable to their periods. Nevertheless,
turbulent fluctuations are small deep inside the inertial range compared to the
background field. 4) Decaying MHD turbulence is unstable to an increase of the
imbalance between the flux of waves propagating in opposite directions along
the magnetic field. 5) Items 1-4 lend support to the model of strong MHD
turbulence by Goldreich & Sridhar (GS). Results from our simulations are also
consistent with the GS prediction gamma=2/3. The sole notable discrepancy is
that 1D power law spectra, E(k_perp) ~ k_perp^{-alpha}, determined from our
simulations exhibit alpha ~ 3/2, whereas the GS model predicts alpha = 5/3.

  It is found that all the models fit the data sets equally well and require
non-zero, positive values of \Lambda. The supernovae data favour an
accelerating expansion of the universe whereas the radio sources data imply
either sign of the deceleration parameter. The estimates of the density
parameter for the variable \Lambda-models are found higher than those for the
constant \Lambda-Friedmann model. It is also found that the Gurvits et al'

to be a low density, vacuum-dominated accelerating universe. However, for
realistic values of the matter density parameter, the only interesting
solutions are (a) estimated from the supernovae data: the best-fit solutions
for the flat models (including the constant \Lambda case); (b) estimated from

estimation using a Wiener filtering technique on simulated data from the
upcoming MAP experiment, set to launch in early 2001. The simulations included
contributions from the three dominant astrophysical components expected in the
five MAP spectral bands, namely CMB radiation, Galactic dust, and synchrotron
emission. We assumed a simple homogeneous and isotropic white noise model and
performed our analysis up to a spherical harmonic multipole lmax=512 on the
fraction of the sky defined by b>20 degrees. We find that the reconstruction
errors are reasonably well fitted by a Gaussian with an rms of 24 $\mu $K, but
with significant deviations in the tails. Our results further support the
predictions on the resulting CMB power spectrum of a previous estimate by
Bouchet and Gispert (1999), which entailed a number of assumptions this work

constraint obtained on f is 0.020^2<f<0.032^2. A reliable lower bound on
J_{-12} can be used to put a lower bound on \Omega_B h^2, which can be compared
with similar constraints obtained from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and CMBR

explained simultaneously if the observed nuclear light is dominated by
scattered nuclear light, though there is a possibility that the nuclear

exponentially decreasing infall, out of extragalactic gas. In a first infall
episode, with a duration of $\sim$ 1 Gyr, the halo and the thick disk were
assembled out of primordial gas, while the thin disk formed in a second episode
of infall of slightly enriched extragalactic gas, with much longer timescale.
The model nicely reproduces the main observational constraints of the solar
neighborhood, and the calculated elemental abundances at the time of the solar
birth are in excellent agreement with the solar abundances. By the inclusion of
metallicity dependent yields for the whole range of stellar masses we follow
the evolution of 76 isotopes of all the chemical elements between hydrogen and
zinc. Those results are confronted with a large and recent body of

Galactic. The increase in obscuration observed at the latter epoch has (Delta
Av)/(Delta Nh) also less than Galactic, supporting a correlation between the
properties of the obscuring matter and its proximity to the center. The
measured Av is compatible with the broad component of Halpha being seen in
transmission, as opposed to scattering, so that most of the observed
polarization must be due to dichroism. The bolometric luminosity of the AGN,
deduced from the X-ray and line luminosities, falls definitely short of
accounting for the IR luminosity of the galaxy, consistent with its coolish

presence of subclustering within coherent subclumps suggests that the
fragmentation process is hierarchical and that young stellar clusters are
assembled by independent substructures. The local (proto-)stellar density and
star formation efficiency within the subclusters are much higher than the
average values for the entire star forming cloud. Unfortunately, current
observations are sparse and limited to the nearest star forming regions, for
spatial resolution and sensitivity considerations, the future millimeter wave
arrays, especially ALMA, will allow to expand considerably the sample of

""extended red emission"" (ERE) from interstellar dust. We calculate the thermal
emission expected from such particles in a reflection nebula such as NGC 2023,
and in the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM). Pure neutral Si SNPs would emit
at 16.4 micron (um), while Si/SiO2 SNPs (both neutral and charged) produce a
feature at 20 um. Observational upper limits on the 16.4 um and 20 um features
in NGC 2023 impose upper limits of < 1.5 ppm in pure Si SNPs, and or < 0.2 ppm
in Si/SiO2 SNPs. The observed ERE intensity from NGC 2023 then gives a lower
bound on the required photoluminescence efficiency eta. For foreground
extinction A(0.68um) = 1.2, we find eta > 5% for Si SNPs, or eta > 24% for
Si/SiO2 SNPs in NGC 2023. Measurement of the R band extinction toward the
ERE-emitting region could strengthen these lower limits. The ERE emissivity of
the diffuse ISM appears to require > 42% (> 33%) of solar Si abundance in
Si/SiO2 (Si) SNPs. We predict IR emission spectra and show that DIRBE
photometry appears to rule out such high abundances of free-flying SNPs in the
diffuse ISM. If the ERE is due to SNPs, they must be either in clusters or
attached to larger grains. Future observations by SIRTF will be even more
sensitive to the presence of free-flying SNPs.

accelerated expansion of the Universe, and indirectly, from measurements of
cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy. Dark energy contributes about 2/3
of the critical density, is very smoothly distributed, and has large negative
pressure. Its nature is very much unknown. Most of its discernible consequences
follow from its effect on evolution of the expansion rate of the Universe,
which in turn affects the growth of density perturbations and the age of the
Universe, and can be probed by the classical kinematic cosmological tests.
Absent a compelling theoretical model (or even a class of models), we describe
the dark energy by an effective equation-of-state w=p_X/\rho_X which is allowed
to vary with time. We describe and compare different approaches for determining

might be gathered by the proposed SNAP satellite. Among other things, we derive
optimal strategies for constraining cosmological parameters using type Ia
supernovae. While in the near term CMB anisotropy will provide the first
measurements of w, supernovae and number counts appear to have the most
potential to probe dark energy.

stochasticity and nonlinearity become appreciable and strongly

deterministic linear biasing $\delta_{\rm obj}\simeq b_{\rm obj} \delta_{\rm

distribution ($10^{48}$ erg for GRB9809425; $3\times 10^{51}\div 2\times

relativistic objects ($M_{NS}=(1.35\pm 0.15) M_\odot$; $M_{BH}=(4\div 15)
M_\odot$). The peculiarity of SN1998bw can be related to the rotation of the
collapsing CO-core. The expected galactic collapse rate of CO-cores of most
compact WR stars of type WO is $\sim 10^{-5}$ per year, only by one and a half
order of magnitude higher than the GRB rate. The allowance for a gamma-ray
beaming or random outcome of the CO-core collapse due to some instabilities
brings this rate in accordance GRB rate. We argue that WR stars (most probably,
of type WO) can be considered as progenitors of cosmic gamma-ray bursts. Two
types of GRBs are predicted in correspondence with the bimodal mass
distribution of the relativistic objects. Three types of optical afterglows
should appear depending on which CO-core is collapsing: of a single WR star, of
a WR star in a WR+O or a hypothetic WR+(A-M) binary system. We briefly discuss
a model of GRB as a transient phenomenon occurring at early stages of galactic

terms of the random walk theory. The formulation is applicable to any value of
the shock speed and the particle speed, in particular to the acceleration in
relativistic shocks, as long as large angle scattering is suitable for the
scattering process of particles. We first show that the trajectory of a
particle suffering from large angle scattering can be treated as a random walk
in a moving medium with an absorbing boundary (e.g., the shock front). We
derive an integral equation to determine the density of scattering points of
the random walk, and by solving it approximately we obtain approximate
solutions of the probability density of pitch angle at and the return
probability after the shock crossing in analytical form. These approximate
solutions include corrections of several non-diffusive effects to the
conventional diffusion approximation and we show that they agree well with the
Monte Carlo results for isotropic scattering model for any shock speed and
particle speed. Finally, we give an analytical expression of the spectral index
of accelerated particles in parallel shocks valid for arbitrary shock speed.

observation which are suggestive of an outflow which is generated very close to
the black hole, within a few tens of Schwarzschild radii. In the presence of
mass loss (e.g., an outflowing wind), the electron density of matter within the
centrifugal pressure supported region (which generates hard X-rays) goes down
and it is easier to cool these electrons by soft photons coming from the
Keplerian disk. If, on the other hand, the post-shock region gains mass from
outside, the spectra would be harder. These properties of spectral `softening'
of the low state and `hardening' of the high state have been detected in
several days of RXTE data of GRS1915+105 which we present here.

thermonuclear X-ray bursts were discovered with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer
(RXTE) in early 1996. Spectral and timing evidence strongly supports the
conclusion that these oscillations are caused by rotational modulation of the
burst emission and that they reveal the spin frequency of neutron stars in low
mass X-ray binaries, a long sought goal of X-ray astronomy. Studies carried out
over the past year have led to the discovery of burst oscillations in four new
sources, bringing to ten the number with confirmed burst oscillations. I review
the status of our knowledge of these oscillations and indicate how they can be
used to probe the physics of neutron stars. For a few burst oscillation sources
it has been proposed that the strongest and most ubiquitous frequency is
actually the first overtone of the spin frequency and hence that two nearly
antipodal hot spots are present on the neutron star. This inference has
important implications for both the physics of thermonuclear burning as well as
the mass - radius relation for neutron stars, so its confirmation is crucial. I
discuss recent attempts to confirm this hypothesis for 4U 1636-53, the source
for which a signal at the putative fundamental (290 Hz) has been claimed.

cluster. Calibrated with Galactic globular cluster data and spectrophotometric
population models, the colors indicated that dwarf ellipticals have a mean
[Fe/H] of -1.00+/-0.28 ranging from -1.6 to -0.4. The mean age of dwarf
ellipticals, also determined photometrically, is estimated at 10+/-1 Gyrs
compared to 13 Gyrs for bright Fornax ellipticals. Comparison of our
metallicity color and Mg_2 indices demonstrates that the [Mg/Fe] ratio is lower
in dwarf ellipticals than their more massive cousins, which is consistent with
a longer duration of initial star formation to explain their younger ages.
There is a increase in dwarf metallicity with distance from the Fornax cluster
center where core galaxies are, on average, 0.5 dex more metal-poor than halo
dwarfs. In addition, we find the halo dwarfs are younger in mean age compared
to core dwarfs. One possible explanation is that the intracluster medium ram
pressure strips the gas from dwarf ellipticals halting star formation (old age)
and stopping enrichment (low metallicity) as they enter the core.

of three types: which we identify as HW (hard state with winds), CC (Compton
cooling) and EA (enhanced accretion) respectively. Apart from these three
states there are two more fundamental states in a black hole accretion which
are soft and hard states. We also find that winds and outflows could soften

the drainage of the excess matter, the disk goes back to the `Off' state. Our

Abell and APM cluster samples. The APM cluster sample with measured redshifts
covers a small volume which contains only a few very rich superclusters that
surround one void and have exceptionally large mutual separations. Due to this
property the maximum of the power spectrum of APM clusters with measured
velocities is shifted to larger scales than the corresponding feature in the
power spectrum of Abell clusters. We conclude that the APM sample is not
representative for the large-scale structure as a whole due to the small space
coverage. We present a catalog of superclusters of galaxies, based on APM
clusters up to a redshift z_{lim}=0.13.

  Lacertae: future eclipses","32 pages, including figures and tables. Accepted for The Astronomical
  Journal, April 2001",,10.1086/319942,,astro-ph,,"  Eclipses in the 14.4-day period double-lined binary SS Lac were observed
photographically and visually early in the 20th century, but stopped some 50 or
60 years ago. This has been explained by the presence of a distant third star
in the system, which has now been detected spectroscopically with a period of
679 days. The plane of the orbit of the binary is changing relative to the line
of sight in response to perturbations from this third object. A recent analysis
by Milone et al. (M00) of all photometric material available for the system,
including a re-measurement of original Harvard plates, has confirmed earlier
reports of changes in the depth of the eclipses as a function of time, which
are due to the third star. In this paper we discuss our detailed analysis of
the eclipse amplitude measurements, and extract from them information on the
change in the inclination angle of the binary over the last century. Our use of
a much improved ephemeris for the system by Torres & Stefanik was found to be
crucial, and prompted us to re-determine all the amplitudes from the historical
data at our disposal, including the Harvard material used by M00.
Systematically lower measurements on the branches of the minima were properly
accounted for, and we made use of both a linear approximation to the time
variation of the inclination angle and a more realistic model based on the
theory of three-body interactions (""regression of the nodes"" effect). The nodal
cycle is found to be about 600 yr, within which TWO eclipse ""seasons"" occur,
each lasting about 100 yr. The non-eclipsing status of the system is expected
to continue until the beginning of the 23rd century.

evolution of low-mass helium white dwarfs (WD). Attention is focused on the
occurrence of hydrogen shell flashes induced by diffusion processes during
cooling phases. Initial models from 0.406 to 0.161 solar masses are constructed
by applying mass loss rates at different stages of the RGB evolution of a solar
model. The multicomponent flow equations describing gravitational settling, and
chemical and thermal diffusion are solved and the diffusion calculations are
coupled to an evolutionary code. In addition, the same sequences are computed
but neglecting diffusion. We find that element diffusion strongly affects the
structure and cooling history of helium WD. In particular, diffusion induces
the occurrence of hydrogen shell flashes in models with masses ranging from
0.18 to 0.41 solar masses, which is in sharp contrast from the situation when
diffusion is neglected. In connection with the further evolution, these
diffusion-induced flashes lead to much thinner hydrogen envelopes, preventing
stable nuclear burning from being an appreciable energy source at advanced
stages of evolution. This implies much shorter cooling ages than in the case
when diffusion is neglected. These new WD models are discussed in light of
recent observational data of some millisecond pulsar systems with WD
companions. We find that age discrepancies between the predictions of standard
evolutionary models and such observations appear to be the result of ignoring
element diffusion in such models. Indeed, such discrepancies vanish when
account is made of diffusion.

the ground has rejuvenated the study of young star clusters. A recurrent
morphological theme found in nearby resolved sytems is the observation of young

M_sun/pc**3) clusters which have evacuated the gas and dust from a spherical
region around themselves. New stars are being triggered into formation along
the edges of the envelopes, with pillars (similar to the Eagle Nebula) of
molecular gas streaming away from the the regions of star formation. The
prototype for these objects is 30 Doradus. Another major theme has been the
discovery of large numbers of young (typically 1 - 500 Myr), massive (10**3 -
10**7 M_sun), compact star clusters in merging, starbursting, and even some
barred and spiral galaxies. The brightest of these clusters have all the
attributes expected of protoglobular clusters, hence allowing us to study the
formation of globular clusters in the local universe rather than trying to
ascertain how they formed ~14 Gyr ago. The prototype is the Antennae Galaxy.

passive scalar advected by the Gaussian self-similar velocity field with finite
correlation time and in the presence of an imposed linear mean gradient. The
energy spectrum in the inertial range has the form $E(k)\propto
k^{1-\epsilon}$, and the correlation time at the wavenumber k scales as
$k^{-2+\eta}$. It is shown that, depending on the values of the exponents
$\epsilon$ and $\eta$, the model in the inertial range reveals various types of
scaling regimes associated with the infrared stable fixed points of the RG
equations: diffusive-type regimes for which the advection can be treated within
ordinary perturbation theory, and three nontrivial convection-type regimes for
which the correlation functions exhibit anomalous scaling behavior. Explicit
asymptotic expressions for the structure functions and other correlation
functions are obtained; they are represented by superpositions of power laws
with nonuniversal amplitudes and universal (independent of the anisotropy)
anomalous exponents, calculated to the first order in $\epsilon$ and $\eta$ in
any space dimension. For the first nontrivial regime the anomalous exponents
are the same as in the rapid-change version of the model; for the second they
are the same as in the model with time-independent (frozen) velocity field. In
these regimes, the anomalous exponents are universal in the sense that they
depend only on the exponents entering into the velocity correlator. For the
last regime the exponents are nonuniversal (they can depend also on the
amplitudes); however, the nonuniversality can reveal itself only in the second
order of the RG expansion. Comments: Extended version accepted to Phys. Rev. E.

widths in ergodic metastable wells can be approximated as easily-calculated
matrix elements involving the wavefunction in the neighbourhood of a certain
real orbit. This orbit is a continuation of the complex orbit which crosses the
barrier with minimum imaginary action. The matrix element is computed by
integrating across the orbit in a surface of section representation, and uses
only the wavefunction in the allowed region and the stability properties of the
orbit. When the real orbit is periodic, the matrix element is a natural measure
of the degree of scarring of the wavefunction. This scarring measure is
canonically invariant and independent of the choice of surface of section,
within semiclassical error. The result can alternatively be interpretated as
the autocorrelation function of the state with respect to a transfer operator
which quantises a certain complex surface of section mapping. The formula
provides an efficient numerical method to compute tunnelling rates while
avoiding the need for the exceedingly precise diagonalisation endemic to
numerical tunnelling calculations.

eddies results in the observed global weather patterns with long-range
spatiotemporal correlations such as that of the widely investigated El Nino
phenomenon. Large eddies are visualised as envelopes enclosing smaller eddies,
thereby generating a hierarchy of eddy circulations, originating initially from
a fixed primary small scale energising perturbation, e.g. the frictional upward
momentum flux at the boundary layer of the earth's surface. In this paper it is
shown that the relative motion concepts of Einstein's special and general
theories of relativity are applicable to eddy circulations originating from a

experimental results to establish the need for the development of a theoretical
framework and classification of the bifurcations resulting from border
collision. We then present a systematic analysis of such bifurcations by
deriving a normal form --- the piecewise linear approximation in the
neighborhood of the border. We show that there can be eleven qualitatively
different types of border collision bifurcations depending on the parameters of
the normal form, and these are classified under six cases. We present a
partitioning of the parameter space of the normal form showing the regions
where different types of bifurcations occur. This theoretical framework will
help in explaining bifurcations in all systems which can be represented by two

processing computers co-ordinating memory related responses to a multitude of
input signals from sensory organs. Information storage, update and appropriate
retrieval are controlled at the molecular level by the neuronal cytoskeleton
which serves as the internal communication network within neurons. Information
flow in the highly ordered parallel networks of the filamentous protein
polymers which make up the cytoskeleton may be compared to atmospheric flows
which exhibit long-range spatiotemporal correlations, i.e. long-term memory.
Such long-range spatiotemporal correlations are ubiquitous to real world
dynamical systems and is recently identified as signature of self-organized
criticality or chaos. The signatures of self-organized criticality i.e.
long-range temporal correlations have recently been identified in the
electrical activity of the brain. A recently developed non-deterministic cell
dynamical system model for atmospheric flows predicts the observed long-range
spatiotemporal correlations as intrinsic to quantum-like mechanics governing
flow dynamics. The model visualises large scale circulations to form as the
result of spatial integration of enclosed small scale perturbations with
intrinsic two-way ordered energy flow between the scales. Such a concept maybe
applied for the collection and integration of a multitude of signals at the
cytoskeletal level and manifested in activation of neurons in the macroscale.
The cytoskeleton networks inside neurons may be the elementary units of a
unified dynamic memory circulation network with intrinsic global response to
local stimuli.

related to sums of cubes, for which one again expects number theoretic

functions. The semiclassical sum is contracted so that only of order N T^(3/2)
operations are needed for an N-state system evolved for T time steps. This is
typically less than the computational load for quantum propagation, T N^2. This
method enables us to obtain semiclassical results up to the Heisenberg time,

properties of open quantum systems with a chaotic classical limit. Antiscars
lead to a large number of exponentially narrow resonances when the opening is
located on a short unstable orbit of the closed system; the probability to
remain in the system at long times is thus exponentially enhanced over the
random matrix theory prediction. The distribution of resonance widths and the
probability to remain are quantitatively given in terms of only the stability
matrix of the orbit on which the opening is placed. The long-time remaining
probability density is non-trivially distributed over the available phase
space; it can be enhanced or suppressed near orbits other than the one on which
the lead is located, depending on the periods and classical actions of these
other orbits. These effects of the short periodic orbits on quantum decay rates
have no classical counterpart, and first appear on times scales much larger
than the Heisenberg time of the system. All the predictions are quantitatively
compared with numerical data.

coupling, in which each inverted pendulum is coupled to all the other ones with
equal strength, the zero-coupling critical point and an infinity of critical
line segments constitute the same critical set in the $A-c$ plane,
independently of $N$. However, for any other nonglobal-coupling cases of
shorter-range couplings, the structure of the critical set becomes different
from that for the global-coupling case, because of a significant change in the
stability diagram of periodic orbits born via period doublings. The critical
scaling behaviors on the critical set are also found to be the same as those
for the abstract system of the coupled one-dimensional maps.

for a more coherent and unified treatment of contributions of periodic orbits

to be exponentially small only for a particular type of bifurcation (the
extremal one). In all other cases complex orbits give rise to corrections in
powers of $\hbar$ and, unlike the former one, their contribution is hidden in

on a toral phase space. In the framework of this phase space, a quantum state
must satisfy Bloch boundary conditions (BCs) on a torus and the spectrum
consists of a finite number of levels for given BCs. As the BCs are varied, a
level broadens into a band. The BHD for a band is defined as the uniform
average of the Husimi distributions for all the eigenstates in the band. The
generalized BHD for a set of adjacent bands is the average of the BHDs
associated with these bands. BHDs are shown to be closer, in several aspects,
to classical distributions than Husimi distributions for individual
eigenstates. The generalized BHD for two adjacent bands is shown to be
approximately conserved in the passage through a degeneracy between the bands
as a nonintegrability parameter is varied. Finally, it is shown how generalized
BHDs can be defined so as to achieve physical continuity under small variations
of the scaled Planck constant. A generalization of the topological
(Chern-index) characterization of the classical-quantum correspondence is then
obtained.

properties of individual quantum eigenstates in the classical limit. We note
that the well known Schnirelman result is a weaker form of quantum ergodicity
than the one implied by random matrix theory. This suggests the possibility of
systems with non-gaussian random eigenstates which are nonetheless ergodic in
the sense of Schnirelman and lead to ergodic transport in the classical limit.
These we call ""weakly quantum ergodic.'' Indeed for a class of ""slow ergodic""
classical systems, it is found that each eigenstate becomes localized to an
ever decreasing fraction of the available state space, in the semiclassical
limit. Nevertheless, each eigenstate in this limit covers phase space evenly on
any classical scale, and long-time transport properties betwen individual
quantum states remain ergodic due to the diffractive effects which dominate
quantum phase space exploration.

order to evaluate the long term usefulness of the nonlinear time series

corresponding methods become more widely accessible. This paper, while not a
proper review on nonlinear time series analysis, tries to make a contribution
to this process by describing the actual implementation of the algorithms, and
their proper usage. Most of the methods require the choice of certain
parameters for each specific time series application. We will try to give

guarantees no mixing of maps across their mean field in the chaotic transient
process. In the turbulent regime of GCML there is a prominent period three
window. In the correlator analysis we also find a remnant of periodic motion of
quasi-clusters with high rate mixing almost everywhere in the turbulent regime
of the large-size GCML. The so-called hidden coherence is the most modest
remnant. The EGCML shares the same intriguing properties with GCML and exhibits
an amazing spatial cluster formation during the chaotic transient process. An
analytic approach is proposed which relates the periodicity manifestation in
the turbulent regime of GCML to the periodic window of a single logistic map.

dynamical system model shows that such non-local connections are intrinsic to
quantum-like chaos governing flow dynamics. The dynamical evolution of fractal
structures can be quantified in terms of ordered energy flow described by
mathematical functions which occur in the field of number theory. The
quantum-like chaos in atmospheric flows can be quantified in terms of the
following mathematical functions / concepts: (1) The fractal structure of the
flow pattern is resolved into an overall logarithmic spiral trajectory with the
quasiperiodic Penrose tiling pattern for the internal structure and is
equivalent to a hierarchy of vortices. The incorporation of Fibonacci
mathematical series, representative of ramified bifurcations, indicates ordered
growth of fractal patterns. (2) The steady state emergence of progressively
larger fractal structures incorporates unique primary perturbation domains of
progressively increasing number equal to z/lnz where z, the length step growth
stage is equal to the length scale ratio of large eddy to turbulent eddy. In
number theory z/lnz gives the number of primes less than z. The model also
predicts that z/lnz represents the normalised cumulative variance spectrum of
the eddies and which follows statistical normal distribution. The important
result of the study is that the prime number spectrum is the same as the eddy
energy spectrum for quantum-like chaos in atmospheric flows.

functions for {\em all} of the band eigenstates can be reproduced from the
Wigner BD. Also, BDs are shown to be closer to classical distributions than
eigenstate distributions. Generalized BDs, associated with sets of adjacent
bands, are used to extend in a natural way the Chern-index characterization of
the classical-quantum correspondence on the torus to arbitrary rational values
of the scaled Planck constant.

  submitted, REVTex, 22 pages, 15 eps figures",,,,chao-dyn nlin.CD,,"  We present a model of hydrodynamic turbulence for which the program of
computing the scaling exponents from first principles can be developed in a
controlled fashion. The model consists of $N$ suitably coupled copies of the
""Sabra"" shell model of turbulence. The couplings are chosen to include two
components: random and deterministic, with a relative importance that is
characterized by a parameter called $\epsilon$. It is demonstrated, using
numerical simulations of up to 25 copies and 28 shells that in the $N\to
\infty$ limit but for $0<\epsilon\le 1$ this model exhibits correlation
functions whose scaling exponents are anomalous. The theoretical calculation of
the scaling exponents follows verbatim the closure procedure suggested recently
for the Navier-Stokes problem, with the additional advantage that in the $N\to
\infty$ limit the parameter $\epsilon$ can be used to regularize the closure
procedure. The main result of this paper is a finite and closed set of
scale-invariant equations for the 2nd and 3rd order statistical objects of the
theory. This set of equations takes into account terms up to order $\epsilon^4$
and neglects terms of order $\epsilon^6$. Preliminary analysis of this set of
equations indicates a K41 normal scaling at $\epsilon = 0 $, with a birth of
anomalous exponents at larger values of $\epsilon$, in agreement with the
numerical simulations.

highly improved convergence of calculations of dynamical averages in generic

that forced-damped fluids can be equally well represented by means of the
Navier-Stokes equations and by means of time reversible dynamical systems
called GNS. In the GNS systems, the usual viscosity is replaced by a
state-dependent dissipation term which fixes one global quantity. The principle
states that the mean values of properly chosen observables are the same for
both representations of the fluid. In the same paper, the chaotic hypothesis of
Gallavotti and Cohen is applied to hydrodynamics, leading to the conjecture
that entropy fluctuations in the GNS system verify a relation first observed in
nonequilibrium molecular dynamics. We tested these ideas in the case of
two-dimensional fluids. We examined the fluctuations of global quadratic
quantities in the statistically stationary state of a) the Navier-Stokes
equations; b) the GNS equations. Our results are consistent with the validity
of the fluctuation relation, and of the equivalence principle, indicating
possible extensions thereof. Moreover, in these results the difference between
the Gallavotti-Cohen fluctuation theorem and the Evans-Searles identity is
evident.

Numerical simulations were done to compare theory to measurement across a range
of $\epsilon$ values. Next, as an illustration of defining the Lyapunov
exponent on many channel passes, a simulation of the intermittent transition in
the logistic map is described. The modified theory for the channels is
explained and a simple model for the gate entrance rates is constructed. An
important correction due to the discrete nature of the iterative flow is
identified and incorporated in an improved model. Realistic fits to the data

energy transfer are studied: the energy fluxes, and the energy transfer between
different wavenumber regions ({\it shells}). The picture of energy fluxes that
emerges is quite complex - there is a forward cascade of magnetic energy, an
inverse cascade of kinetic energy, a flux of energy from the kinetic to the
magnetic field, and a reverse flux which transfers the energy back to the
kinetic from the magnetic. The energy transfer between different wave number
shells is also complex - local and nonlocal transfers often possess opposing
features, i.e., energy transfer between some wave number shells occurs from
kinetic to magnetic, and between other wave number shells this transfer is
reversed. The net transfer of energy is from kinetic to magnetic. The results
obtained from the flux studies and the shell-to-shell energy transfer studies
are consistent with each other.

analysis (SSA) to the study of nonstationary time series of length $N$ whose
intermittency can give rise to the divergence of their variance. SSA relies on
the construction of the lag-covariance matrix C on M lagged copies of the time
series over a fixed window width W to detect the regular part of the
variability in that window in terms of the minimal number of oscillatory
components; here W = M Dt, with Dt the time step. The proposed multi-scale SSA
is a local SSA analysis within a moving window of width M <= W <= N.
Multi-scale SSA varies W, while keeping a fixed W/M ratio, and uses the
eigenvectors of the corresponding lag-covariance matrix C_M as a data-adaptive
wavelets; successive eigenvectors of C_M correspond approximately to successive
derivatives of the first mother wavelet in standard wavelet analysis.
Multi-scale SSA thus solves objectively the delicate problem of optimizing the
analyzing wavelet in the time-frequency domain, by a suitable localization of
the signal's covariance matrix. We present several examples of application to
synthetic signals with fractal or power-law behavior which mimic selected
features of certain climatic and geophysical time series. A real application is
to the Southern Oscillation index (SOI) monthly values for 1933-1996. Our
methodology highlights an abrupt periodicity shift in the SOI near 1960. This
abrupt shift between 4 and 3 years supports the Devil's staircase scenario for

of the Gutzwiller trace formula with the ``hbar'' corrections computed an order

shell model is investigated. It is argued that this model might have a closer

model coincides with the Sabra model proposed by L'vov et al. \cite{lvov}, for
a specific choice of the free parameters of their model. The model has for this

flow. The model has two inviscid invariants governing the dynamical behavior.
Depending on the choice of interaction coefficients, or coupling parameters,
the two invariants are either both positive definite, analogous to energy and
enstrophy of 2D flow, or only one is positive definite and the other not,
analogous to energy and helicity of 3D flow. In the 2D like model the dynamics
depend on the spectral ratio of enstrophy to energy. That ratio depends on
wave-number as $k^{\alpha}$. The enstrophy transfer through the inertial
sub-range can be described as a forward cascade for $\alpha < 2$ and a
diffusion in a statistical equilibrium for $\alpha > 2$. The $\alpha =2$ case,
corresponding to 2D turbulence, is a borderline between the two descriptions.
The difference can be understood in terms of the ratio of typical timescales in
the inertial sub-range and in the viscous sub-range. The multi fractality of
the enstrophy dissipation also depends on the parameter $\alpha$, and seems to
be related to the ratio of typical timescales of the different shell
velocities.

This feature is different from the weak superdiffusion regime, i.e.

can be generated by nontrivial chaotic dynamics, e.g. Lagrangian motion in $2d$
time-dependent incompressible velocity fields, $2d$ symplectic maps and $1d$

the characteristic wave length. Then, for a specified time dependent shape
variation, the quantum dynamics of a particle inside the billiard is integrated
directly. In particular, the dispersion of the energy is studied in the
Bunimovich stadium billiard with oscillating boundary. The results showed that
the distribution of energy spreads diffusively for the first oscillations of
the boundary (${< \Delta^2 E}> =2 D t$). We studied the diffusion contant $D$
as a function of the boundary velocity and found differences with theoretical
predictions based on random matrix theory. By extracting highly phase space
localized structures from the spectrum, previous differences were reduced
significantly. This fact provides the first numerical evidence of the influence
of phase space localization on the quantum diffusion of a chaotic system.

of the Wigner's quasi-probability distribution function in presence of

fluctuations in the curvature of the potential due to classical chaos and
dissipation. A stochastic treatment of this classical fluctuations leads us to
a Fokker-Planck equation which is reminiscent of Kramers' equation for
thermally activated processes. This reveals an interplay of three aspects of
evolution of quantum noise in weakly dissipative open systems; the reversible
Liouville flow, the irreversible chaotic diffusion which is characteristic of
the system itself, and irreversible dissipation induced by the external
reservoir. It has been demonstrated that in the dissipation-free case a
competition between Liouville flow in the contracting direction of phase space
and chaotic diffusion sets a critical width in the Wigner function for quantum
fluctuations. We also show how the initial quantum noise gets amplified by
classical chaos and ultimately equilibrated under the influence of dissipation.
We establish that there exists a critical limit to the expansion of phase
space. The limit is determined by chaotic diffusion and dissipation. Making use
of appropriate quantum-classical correspondence we verify the semiclassical
analysis by the fully quantum simulation in a chaotic quartic oscillator.

tries to clarify the concepts and effects of eigenfunction scarring. We propose
a new, universal scar measure which takes into account an entire periodic orbit
and the linearized dynamics in its vicinity. This measure is tuned to pick out
those structures which are induced in quantum eigenstates by unstable periodic
orbits and their manifolds. It gives enhanced scarring strength as measured by
eigenstate overlaps and inverse participation ratios, especially for longer
orbits. We also discuss off-resonance scars which appear naturally on either
side of an unstable periodic orbit.

mechanics of the billiard in the triaxial ellipsoid is investigated. The system
is separable in ellipsoidal coordinates. A smooth description of the motion is
given in terms of a geodesic flow on a solid torus, which is a fourfold cover
of the interior of the ellipsoid. Two crossing separatrices lead to four
generic types of motion. The action variables of the system are integrals of a
single Abelian differential of second kind on a hyperelliptic curve of genus 2.
The classical separability carries over to quantum mechanics giving two
versions of generalized Lam{\'e} equations according to the two sets of
classical coordinates. The quantum eigenvalues define a lattice when
transformed to classical action space. Away from the separatrix surfaces the
lattice is given by EBK quantization rules for the four types of classical
motion. The transition between the four lattices is described by a uniform
semiclassical quantization scheme based on a WKB ansatz. The tunneling between
tori is given by penetration integrals which again are integrals of the same
Abelian differential that gives the classical action variables. It turns out
that the quantum mechanics of ellipsoidal billiards is semiclassically most
elegantly explained by the investigation of its hyperelliptic curve and the
real and purely imaginary periods of a single Abelian differential.

was assessed in three hundred and twenty three patients admitted with AMI
during the two-year period June 1992 to May 1994. The influence of the
following meteorological, solar-geophysical and cosmic parameters in the
causation of an infarct was also considered : (1) surface pressure (2) maximum
temperature (3) minimum temperature (4) relative humidity (5) cosmic ray index
(6) geomagnetic aa index (7) solar flares and (8) sunspot number. A well
pronounced diurnal variability in AMI with a peak in the morning hours (6-12
a.m.) was seen. Further analysis of the data by considering one-hour periods
revealed the presence of a smaller evening (10 p.m.) increase in incidence,
i.e., the existence of a bimodal circadian rhythm. The simultaneous occurrence
of the well documented semi-diurnal rhythm in surface pressure and incidence of
acute myocardial infarction were evident. This may be one of the factors
involved in the causation of the smaller evening peak-the reasons for which
were unclear till now. Month-to-month variation in surface pressure was also
found to be significantly correlated with incidence of acute myocardial
infarction. Recognition of a circadian rhythm in the onset of AMI suggests the
need for enhanced pharmacological protection during the vulnerable periods.
Significant correlations were also found between monthly incidence of AMI and
month-to-month variation of cosmic ray index and solar flare counts. The
pattern of incidence of AMI was seen to be modified by full moon and new moon.
There was no association between maximum temperature, minimum temperature or
relative humidity and incidence of AMI.

For a range of parameter values, competing attractors exist. The Kaplan-Yorke
dimension and the correlation dimension of the chaotic attractor are
numerically calculated and compared to the values found in the uncoupled Lorenz

observed. The intermittent behaviour occurs near a Neimark-Sacker bifurcation

traditional approach to equilibrium point of view of Boltzmann. The
nonequilibrium steady states, in presence of a Gaussian thermostat, are
described by SRB measures. In terms of these one can prove the Gallavotti-Cohen
fluctuation theorem. One can also prove a general linear response formula and
study its consequences, which are not restricted to near equilibrium
situations. Under suitable conditions the nonequilibrium steady states satisfy
the pairing theorem of Dettmann and Morriss. The results just mentioned hold so
far only for classical systems; they do not involve large size, i.e., they hold
without a thermodynamic limit.

method of conducting hypothesis testing over word-based distributions in
categories suffers from the data sparseness problem. In order to address this
difficulty, Guthrie et.al. have developed a method using distributions based on
hard clustering of words, i.e., in which a word is assigned to a single cluster
and words in the same cluster are treated uniformly. This method might,
however, degrade classification results, since the distributions it employs are
not always precise enough for representing the differences between categories.
We propose here the use of soft clustering of words, i.e., in which a word can
be assigned to several different clusters and each cluster is characterized by
a specific word probability distribution. We define for each document category
a finite mixture model, which is a linear combination of the probability
distributions of the clusters. We thereby treat the problem of classifying
documents as that of conducting statistical hypothesis testing over finite
mixture models. In order to accomplish this testing, we employ the EM algorithm
which helps efficiently estimate parameters in a finite mixture model.
Experimental results indicate that our method outperforms not only the method
using distributions based on hard clustering, but also the method using
word-based distributions and the method based on cosine-similarity.

logical descriptions of natural language phenomena in exact terms. Describing
some of these phenomena may, however, require some form of graded distinctions
which are not provided by such grammars. Recent approaches to weighted
constraint logic grammars attempt to address this issue by adding numerical
calculation schemata to the deduction scheme of the underlying CLP framework.
Currently, these extralogical extensions are not related to the model-theoretic
counterpart of the operational semantics of CLP, i.e., they do not come with a
formal semantics at all. The aim of this paper is to present a clear formal
semantics for weighted constraint logic grammars, which abstracts away from
specific interpretations of weights, but nevertheless gives insights into the
parsing problem for such weighted grammars. Building on the formalization of
constraint logic grammars in the CLP scheme of Hoehfeld and Smolka 1988, this
formal semantics will be given by a quantitative version of CLP. Such a
quantitative CLP scheme can also be valuable for CLP tasks independent of
grammars.

the feature structures subsumed by the ambiguous representation. This work
extends a line of research [Billot and Lang 89, Lang 94] which stresses the
connection between charts and grammars: a chart can be seen as a specialization
of the reference grammar for a given input string. We show how this
specialization grammar can be transformed into an interaction-free form which
has the same practicality as a listing of the individual solutions, but is

experimental results that were reported only in the talk version of that paper.
Eisner (1996) trained three probability models on a small set of about 4,000
conjunction-free, dependency-grammar parses derived from the Wall Street
Journal section of the Penn Treebank, and then evaluated the models on a
held-out test set, using a novel O(n^3) parsing algorithm.
  The present paper describes some details of the experiments and repeats them
with a larger training set of 25,000 sentences. As reported at the talk, the
more extensive training yields greatly improved performance. Nearly half the
sentences are parsed with no misattachments; two-thirds are parsed with at most
one misattachment.
  Of the models described in the original written paper, the best score is
still obtained with the generative (top-down) ""model C."" However, slightly
better models are also explored, in particular, two variants on the
comprehension (bottom-up) ""model B."" The better of these has an attachment
accuracy of 90%, and (unlike model C) tags words more accurately than the
comparable trigram tagger. Differences are statistically significant.
  If tags are roughly known in advance, search error is all but eliminated and
the new model attains an attachment accuracy of 93%. We find that the parser of
Collins (1996), when combined with a highly-trained tagger, also achieves 93%
when trained and tested on the same sentences. Similarities and differences are
discussed.

characteristic properties of this domain are (a) very high dimensionality, (b)
both the learned concepts and the instances reside very sparsely in the feature
space, and (c) a high variation in the number of active features in an

typical task of this nature -- text categorization. We argue that these
algorithms -- which categorize documents by learning a linear separator in the
feature space -- have a few properties that make them ideal for this domain. We
then show that a quantum leap in performance is achieved when we further modify
the algorithms to better address some of the specific characteristics of the
domain. In particular, we demonstrate (1) how variation in document length can
be tolerated by either normalizing feature weights or by using negative
weights, (2) the positive effect of applying a threshold range in training, (3)
alternatives in considering feature frequency, and (4) the benefits of
discarding features while training. Overall, we present an algorithm, a
variation of Littlestone's Winnow, which performs significantly better than any
other algorithm tested on this task using a similar feature set.

Marc Vilain and his collaborators. I show how this method makes it possible to
construct contingency tables for computing Cohen's Kappa, a familiar
reliability metric. By comparing recall and precision to reliability on the

Because Kappa factors out chance agreement among coders, it is a preferable
measure for developing annotated corpora where no pre-existing target

implemented and runs in $O(n^4 log(n))$ in sentence length, if the grammar
meets some reasonable `normality' restrictions.

from examples and uses some background knowledge.
  As our parsing model we choose a deterministic shift-reduce type parser that
integrates part-of-speech tagging and syntactic and semantic processing.
Applying machine learning techniques, the system uses parse action examples
acquired under supervision to generate a parser in the form of a decision
structure, a generalization of decision trees.
  To learn good parsing and translation decisions, our system relies heavily on
context, as encoded in currently 205 features describing the morphological,
syntactical and semantical aspects of a given parse state. Compared with recent
probabilistic systems that were trained on 40,000 sentences, our system relies
on more background knowledge and a deeper analysis, but radically fewer
examples, currently 256 sentences.
  We test our parser on lexically limited sentences from the Wall Street
Journal and achieve accuracy rates of 89.8% for labeled precision, 98.4% for
part of speech tagging and 56.3% of test sentences without any crossing
brackets. Machine translations of 32 Wall Street Journal sentences to German
have been evaluated by 10 bilingual volunteers and been graded as 2.4 on a 1.0

preservation.

the textual constraints can be described as a set of constraint equations, and

Database fields include transcriptions, glosses and hyperlinks to speech files.
Database queries are expressed using HTML forms, and these permit regular
expression search on any combination of fields. Regular expressions are passed
directly to a Perl CGI program, enabling the full flexibility of Perl extended
regular expressions. The regular expression notation is extended to better
support phonological searches, such as search for minimal pairs. Search results
are presented in the form of HTML or LaTeX tables, where each cell is either a
number (representing frequency) or a designated subset of the fields. Tables
have up to four dimensions, with an elegant system for specifying which
fragments of which fields should be used for the row/column labels. The tool
offers several advantages over traditional methods of analysis: (i) it supports
a quantitative method of doing phonological research; (ii) it gives universal
access to the same set of informants; (iii) it enables other researchers to
hear the original speech data without having to rely on published
transcriptions; (iv) it makes the full power of regular expression search
available, and search results are full multimedia documents; and (v) it enables
the early refutation of false hypotheses, shortening the
analysis-hypothesis-test loop. A life-size application to an African tone
language (Dschang) is used for exemplification throughout the paper. The
database contains 2200 records, each with approximately 15 fields. Running on a
PC laptop with a stand-alone web server, the `Dschang HyperLexicon' has already
been used extensively in phonological fieldwork and analysis in Cameroon.

the natural third step in a hierarchy that starts with the regular and the
context-free languages. The central notion in this account is that of a
higher-order substitution. Whereas in traditional presentations of rule systems
for abstract language families the emphasis has been on a first-order
substitution process in which auxiliary variables are replaced by elements of
the carrier of the proper algebra - concatenations of terminal and auxiliary
category symbols in the string case - we lift this process to the level of
operations defined on the elements of the carrier of the algebra. Our own view
is that this change of emphasis provides the adequate platform for a better
understanding of the operation of adjunction. To put it in a nutshell:
Adjoining is not a first-order, but a second-order substitution operation.

with multiple successors (MSO) is well suited in many respects as a realistic
formal base for syntactic theorizing. However, the agreeable formal properties
of this logic come at a cost: MSO is equivalent with the class of regular tree
automata/grammars, and, thereby, with the class of context-free languages.
  This paper outlines one approach towards a solution of MSO's expressivity
problem. On the background of an algebraically refined Chomsky hierarchy, which
allows the definition of several classes of languages--in particular, a whole
hierarchy between CF and CS--via regular tree grammars over unambiguously
derivable alphabets of varying complexity plus their respective
yield-functions, it shows that not only some non-context-free string languages
can be captured by context-free means in this way, but that this approach can
be generalized to the corresponding structures. I.e., non-recognizable sets of
structures can--up to homomorphism--be coded context-freely. Since the class of
languages covered--Fischer's (1968} OI family of indexed languages--includes
all attested instances of non-context-freeness in natural language, there
exists an indirect, to be sure, but completely general way to formally describe
the natural languages using a weak framework like MSO.

scoring the goodness of the parse as a predictor of acceptability. We found
that the probability of the worst part is not the best score of acceptability,
indicating that classical generative phonology and Optimality Theory miss an
important fact, as these approaches do not recognise a mechanism by which the
frequency of well-formed parts may ameliorate the unacceptability of
low-frequency parts. We argue that probabilistic generative grammars are
demonstrably a more psychologically realistic model of phonological competence
than standard generative phonology or Optimality Theory.

style manuals (for example Strunk and White (1959) state that ``This. The
pronoun 'this', referring to the complete sense of a preceding sentence or
clause, cannot always carry the load and so may produce an imprecise
statement.''), it is nevertheless very common in written text. Handling this
usage poses a problem for Natural Language Understanding systems. The solution
I propose is based on distinguishing between what can be pointed to and what
can be referred to by virtue of pointing. I argue that a restricted set of
discourse segments yield what such demonstrative pronouns can point to and a
restricted set of what Nunberg (1979) has called referring functions yield what
they can refer to by virtue of that pointing.

framework with file (information state) discourse referents. The proposed
semantics uses a predication on files and discourse referents which is related
to recent developments in dynamic modal predicate calculus. It is argued that a
compositional DRT semantics must employ a semantic type of discourse referents,
as opposed to just a type of individuals. A connection is developed between the
scope effects of epistemic modifiers and the scope-disambiguating effect of ""a

  and Ellen F. Prince, Oxford University Press, 1997",,,cmp-lg cs.CL,,"  Centering was formulated as a model of the relationship between attentional
state, the form of referring expressions, and the coherence of an utterance
within a discourse segment (Grosz, Joshi and Weinstein, 1986; Grosz, Joshi and
Weinstein, 1995). In this chapter, I argue that the restriction of centering to
operating within a discourse segment should be abandoned in order to integrate
centering with a model of global discourse structure. The within-segment
restriction causes three problems. The first problem is that centers are often
continued over discourse segment boundaries with pronominal referring
expressions whose form is identical to those that occur within a discourse
segment. The second problem is that recent work has shown that listeners
perceive segment boundaries at various levels of granularity. If centering
models a universal processing phenomenon, it is implausible that each listener
is using a different centering algorithm.The third issue is that even for
utterances within a discourse segment, there are strong contrasts between
utterances whose adjacent utterance within a segment is hierarchically recent
and those whose adjacent utterance within a segment is linearly recent. This
chapter argues that these problems can be eliminated by replacing Grosz and
Sidner's stack model of attentional state with an alternate model, the cache
model. I show how the cache model is easily integrated with the centering
algorithm, and provide several types of data from naturally occurring
discourses that support the proposed integrated model. Future work should
provide additional support for these claims with an examination of a larger
corpus of naturally occurring discourses.

on a word sense disambiguation task and find that as a whole, their performance
is far superior to that of standard methods. In another set of experiments, we
show that using estimation techniques based on the nearest-neighbor model

statistically significant speech recognition error-rate reduction.

language parsing. Rather than employing EBL for specializing parsers by
inferring new ones, this paper suggests employing EBL for learning how to
reduce ambiguity only partially.
  The present method consists of an EBL algorithm for learning partial-parsers,
and a parsing algorithm which combines partial-parsers with existing
``full-parsers"". The learned partial-parsers, implementable as Cascades of
Finite State Transducers (CFSTs), recognize and combine constituents
efficiently, prohibiting spurious overgeneration. The parsing algorithm
combines a learned partial-parser with a given full-parser such that the role
of the full-parser is limited to combining the constituents, recognized by the
partial-parser, and to recognizing unrecognized portions of the input sentence.
Besides the reduction of the parse-space prior to disambiguation, the present
method provides a way for refining existing disambiguation models that learn
stochastic grammars from tree-banks.
  We exhibit encouraging empirical results using a pilot implementation:
parse-space is reduced substantially with minimal loss of coverage. The speedup
gain for disambiguation models is exemplified by experiments with the DOP
model.

linearly separable form for subsequent processing by a single layer net. Such
networks offer advantages of functional transparency and operational speed.

higher order representation, which can then be analysed by a single layer
network. This transformation is supported by information theoretic analysis.

Amalia, for the linguistic formalism ALE, which is based on typed feature
structures. This formalism is one of the most widely accepted in computational
linguistics and has been used for designing grammars in various linguistic
theories, most notably HPSG. Amalia is composed of data structures and a set of
instructions, augmented by a compiler from the grammatical formalism to the
abstract instructions, and a (portable) interpreter of the abstract
instructions. The effect of each instruction is defined using a low-level
language that can be executed on ordinary hardware.
  The advantages of the abstract machine approach are twofold. From a
theoretical point of view, the abstract machine gives a well-defined
operational semantics to the grammatical formalism. This ensures that grammars
specified using our system are endowed with well defined meaning. It enables,
for example, to formally verify the correctness of a compiler for HPSG, given
an independent definition. From a practical point of view, Amalia is the first
system that employs a direct compilation scheme for unification grammars that

improved performance over existing systems.
  In order to test the machine on a realistic application, we have developed a
small-scale, HPSG-based grammar for a fragment of the Hebrew language, using
Amalia as the development platform. This is the first application of HPSG to a
Semitic language.

implementations of such theories don't usually support bidirectional processing
of grammars. We present a grammar development system that includes a compiler
of grammars (for parsing and generation) to abstract machine instructions, and
an interpreter for the abstract machine language. The generation compiler
inverts input grammars (designed for parsing) to a form more suitable for
generation. The compiled grammars are then executed by the interpreter using
one control strategy, regardless of whether the grammar is the original or the
inverted version. We thus obtain a unified, efficient platform for developing
reversible grammars.

strategy for part-of-speech disambiguation that a) reflects the complexity of
French as an inflected language, b) optimizes the estimation of probabilities,
c) allows the user flexibility in choosing a tagset. The problem in extracting
lexical probabilities from a limited training corpus is that the statistical
model may not necessarily represent the use of a particular word in a
particular context. In a highly morphologically inflected language, this
argument is particularly serious since a word can be tagged with a large number
of parts of speech. Due to the lack of sufficient training data, we argue
against estimating lexical probabilities to disambiguate parts of speech in
unrestricted texts. Instead, we use the strength of contextual probabilities
along with a feature we call ``genotype'', a set of tags associated with a
word. Using this knowledge, we have built a part-of-speech tagger that combines
linguistic and statistical approaches: contextual information is disambiguated
by linguistic rules and n-gram probabilities on parts of speech only are
estimated in order to disambiguate the remaining ambiguous tags.

locally, and iii) EVAL is applied constraint by constraint.
  The parser I propose is implemented in Prolog. It has a number of desirable
consequences. First, it runs and thus provides an existence proof that
syllabification can be implemented in OT. There are a number of other desirable
consequences as well. First, constraints are implemented as finite-state
transducers. Second, the parser makes several interesting claims about the
phonological properties of so-called nonrecoverable insertions and deletions.
Third, the implementation suggests some particular reformulations of some of
the benchmark constraints in the OT arsenal, e.g. *COMPLEX, PARSE, ONSET, and
NOCODA.

measured the agreement among annotators about the classes assigned to definite
descriptions, as well as the agreement about the antecedent assigned to those
definites that the annotators classified as being related to an antecedent in

best for all kinds of properties, so this is an experimental parameter worth
investigating in NLP systems. In addition, the results suggest a way to take
advantage of properties that are low frequency but strongly indicative of a
class. The problems of recognizing and organizing the various kinds of

algorithm of Della-Pietra, Della-Pietra, and Lafferty (1995). Our algorithm
applies to log-linear models in general and is accompanied with suitable

Dalrymple and her colleagues note, LFG's f-structure completeness and coherence
constraints fall out as a by-product of the linear logic machinery they propose
for semantic interpretation, thus making those f-structure mechanisms
redundant. Given that linear logic machinery or something like it is
independently needed for semantic interpretation, it seems reasonable to
explore the extent to which it is capable of handling feature structure
constraints as well.
  R-LFG represents the extreme position that all linguistically required
feature structure dependencies can be captured by the resource-accounting
machinery of a linear or similiar logic independently needed for semantic
interpretation, making LFG's unification machinery redundant. The goal is to
show that LFG linguistic analyses can be expressed as clearly and perspicuously
using the smaller set of mechanisms of R-LFG as they can using the much larger
set of unification-based mechanisms in LFG: if this is the case then we will
have shown that positing these extra f-structure mechanisms is not
linguistically warranted.

by McCarthy and Buvac, that regard context as an undefined primitive whose
formalization can be the same in many different kinds of AI tasks. In
particular, any theory of context in natural language must take the special
nature of natural language into account and cannot regard context simply as an
undefined primitive. I show that there is no such thing as a coherent theory of
context simpliciter -- context pure and simple -- and that context in natural
language is not the same kind of thing as context in KR. In natural language,
context is constructed by the speaker and the interpreter, and both have
considerable discretion in so doing. Therefore, a formalization based on
pre-defined contexts and pre-defined `lifting axioms' cannot account for how
context is used in real-world language.

linguistics literature, they are known to be very slippery entities. The paper
looks at problems with existing accounts of `word sense' and describes the
various kinds of ways in which a word's meaning can deviate from its core
meaning. An analysis is presented in which word senses are abstractions from
clusters of corpus citations, in accordance with current lexicographic
practice. The corpus citations, not the word senses, are the basic objects in
the ontology. The corpus citations will be clustered into senses according to
the purposes of whoever or whatever does the clustering. In the absence of such
purposes, word senses do not exist.
  Word sense disambiguation also needs a set of word senses to disambiguate
between. In most recent work, the set has been taken from a general-purpose
lexical resource, with the assumption that the lexical resource describes the
word senses of English/French/..., between which NLP applications will need to
disambiguate. The implication of the paper is, by contrast, that word senses
exist only relative to a task.

on the widely-used, but little-discussed distinction between an IE system's
foreground lexicon, containing the domain's key terms which map onto the
database fields of the output formalism, and the background lexicon, containing
the remainder of the vocabulary. For the foreground lexicon, human lexicography
is required. For the background lexicon, automatic acquisition is appropriate.
  For the foreground lexicon, WSD will occur as a by-product of finding a
coherent semantic interpretation of the input. WSD techniques as discussed in
recent literature are suited only to the background lexicon. Once the
foreground/background distinction is developed, there is a match between what
is possible, given the state of the art in WSD, and what is required, for
high-quality IE.

  Speakers' Utterances in Spoken Dialog","280 pages, doctoral dissertation (latex with postscript figures)",,,,cmp-lg cs.CL,,"  In this thesis, we present a statistical language model for resolving speech
repairs, intonational boundaries and discourse markers. Rather than finding the
best word interpretation for an acoustic signal, we redefine the speech
recognition problem to so that it also identifies the POS tags, discourse
markers, speech repairs and intonational phrase endings (a major cue in
determining utterance units). Adding these extra elements to the speech
recognition problem actually allows it to better predict the words involved,
since we are able to make use of the predictions of boundary tones, discourse
markers and speech repairs to better account for what word will occur next.
Furthermore, we can take advantage of acoustic information, such as silence
information, which tends to co-occur with speech repairs and intonational
phrase endings, that current language models can only regard as noise in the
acoustic signal. The output of this language model is a much fuller account of
the speaker's turn, with part-of-speech assigned to each word, intonation
phrase endings and discourse markers identified, and speech repairs detected
and corrected. In fact, the identification of the intonational phrase endings,
discourse markers, and resolution of the speech repairs allows the speech
recognizer to model the speaker's utterances, rather than simply the words
involved, and thus it can return a more meaningful analysis of the speaker's
turn for later processing.

  Application of Recurrence Quantification Analysis","8 pages, 7 figures, submitted to Intl. J. Chaos Theory Applications",,,,cmp-lg cs.CL,,"  A methodology based upon recurrence quantification analysis is proposed for
the study of orthographic structure of written texts. Five different
orthographic data sets (20th century Italian poems, 20th century American
poems, contemporary Swedish poems with their corresponding Italian
translations, Italian speech samples, and American speech samples) were
subjected to recurrence quantification analysis, a procedure which has been
found to be diagnostically useful in the quantitative assessment of ordered
series in fields such as physics, molecular dynamics, physiology, and general
signal processing. Recurrence quantification was developed from recurrence
plots as applied to the analysis of nonlinear, complex systems in the physical
sciences, and is based on the computation of a distance matrix of the elements
of an ordered series (in this case the letters consituting selected speech and
poetic texts). From a strictly mathematical view, the results show the
possibility of demonstrating invariance between different language exemplars
despite the apparent low-level of coding (orthography). Comparison with the
actual texts confirms the ability of the method to reveal recurrent structures,
and their complexity. Using poems as a reference standard for judging speech
complexity, the technique exhibits language independence, order dependence and
freedom from pure statistical characteristics of studied sequences, as well as
consistency with easily identifiable texts. Such studies may provide
phenomenological markers of hidden structure as coded by the purely
orthographic level.

discourse markers can be identified during speech recognition, in which the
timeliness of the information can be used to help predict the following words.
We contrast this approach with an alternative machine learning approach
proposed by Litman (1996). This paper also argues that discourse markers can be
used to help the hearer predict the role that the upcoming utterance plays in
the dialog. Thus discourse markers should provide valuable evidence for
automatic dialog act prediction.

which the number of abstraction levels (implemented as sequenced modules) is
reduced from five, via three, to one. The latter system, classifying letter

significantly better generalisation accuracies than the two multi-module

union. If an underlying form has outputs that can meet a given constraint,
lenient composition enforces the constraint; if none of the output candidates
meet the constraint, lenient composition allows all of them. For the sake of
greater efficiency, we may ""leniently compose"" the GEN relation and all the
constraints into a single finite-state transducer that maps each underlying
form directly into its optimal surface realizations, and vice versa, without
ever producing any failing candidates. Seen from this perspective, optimality
theory is surprisingly similar to the two older strains of finite-state
phonology: classical rewrite systems and two-level models. In particular, the
ranking of optimality constraints corresponds to the ordering of rewrite rules.

automata with a very large number of epsilon-moves. The paper identifies three
subset construction algorithms which treat epsilon-moves. A number of
experiments has been performed which indicate that the algorithms differ
considerably in practice. Furthermore, the experiments suggest that the average
number of epsilon-moves per state can be used to predict which algorithm is
likely to perform best for a given input automaton.

disambiguation'', is expected to improve the analytical accuracy for tasks
which are sensitive to lexical semantics. Such tasks include machine
translation, information retrieval, parsing, natural language understanding and
lexicography. Reflecting the growth in utilization of machine readable texts,
word sense disambiguation techniques have been explored variously in the
context of corpus-based approaches. Within one corpus-based framework, that is
the similarity-based method, systems use a database, in which example sentences
are manually annotated with correct word senses. Given an input, systems search
the database for the most similar example to the input. The lexical ambiguity
of a word contained in the input is resolved by selecting the sense annotation
of the retrieved example. In this research, we apply this method of resolution
of verbal polysemy, in which the similarity between two examples is computed as
the weighted average of the similarity between complements governed by a target
polysemous verb. We explore similarity-based verb sense disambiguation focusing
on the following three methods. First, we propose a weighting schema for each
verb complement in the similarity computation. Second, in similarity-based
techniques, the overhead for manual supervision and searching the large-sized
database can be prohibitive. To resolve this problem, we propose a method to
select a small number of effective examples, for system usage. Finally, the
efficiency of our system is highly dependent on the similarity computation
used. To maximize efficiency, we propose a method which integrates the
advantages of previous methods for similarity computation.

Phrasal descriptions are obtained by forming products of lexical expressions
and by cancelling contiguous elements which are inverses of each other. We show
applications of this model to parsing and generation, long-distance movement,
and quantifier scoping. We believe that by moving from the free monoid over a
vocabulary V --- standard in formal language studies --- to the free group over
V, deep affinities between linguistic phenomena and classical algebra come to
the surface, and that the consequences of tapping the mathematical connections

Second, bitext correspondence is noisy. This article presents methods for

the expected behavior of these biases in the presence of sparse data predicts
that they will result in more accurate models. The prediction is confirmed by
evaluation with respect to a gold standard -- translation models that are
biased in this fashion are significantly more accurate than a baseline
knowledge-poor model. This article also shows how a statistical translation
model can take advantage of various kinds of pre-existing knowledge that might
be available about particular language pairs. Even the simplest kinds of
language-specific knowledge, such as the distinction between content words and
function words, is shown to reliably boost translation model performance on
some tasks. Statistical models that are informed by pre-existing knowledge
about the model domain combine the best of both the rationalist and empiricist
traditions.

context-free languages are characterized by definability in the monadic
second-order theory of certain structures. More recently, these descriptive
characterizations have been used to obtain complexity results for constraint-
and principle-based theories of syntax and to provide a uniform model-theoretic
framework for exploring the relationship between theories expressed in
disparate formal terms. These results have been limited, to an extent, by the
lack of descriptive characterizations of language classes beyond the
context-free. Recently, we have shown that tree-adjoining languages (in a
mildly generalized form) can be characterized by recognition by automata
operating on three-dimensional tree manifolds, a three-dimensional analog of
trees. In this paper, we exploit these automata-theoretic results to obtain a
characterization of the tree-adjoining languages by definability in the monadic
second-order theory of these three-dimensional tree manifolds. This not only
opens the way to extending the tools of model-theoretic syntax to the level of
TALs, but provides a highly flexible mechanism for defining TAGs in terms of
logical constraints.

learn language and to build programs that can understand language. Using a
representation that makes the relevant features explicit is a prerequisite for
successful learning and understanding. Therefore, I chose to represent
relations between individual words explicitly in my model. Lexical attraction
is defined as the likelihood of such relations. I introduce a new class of
probabilistic language models named lexical attraction models which can
represent long distance relations between words and I formalize this new class
of models using information theory.
  Within the framework of lexical attraction, I developed an unsupervised
language acquisition program that learns to identify linguistic relations in a
given sentence. The only explicitly represented linguistic knowledge in the
program is lexical attraction. There is no initial grammar or lexicon built in
and the only input is raw text. Learning and processing are interdigitated. The
processor uses the regularities detected by the learner to impose structure on
the input. This structure enables the learner to detect higher level
regularities. Using this bootstrapping procedure, the program was trained on
100 million words of Associated Press material and was able to achieve 60%
precision and 50% recall in finding relations between content-words. Using
knowledge of lexical attraction, the program can identify the correct relations
in syntactically ambiguous sentences such as ``I saw the Statue of Liberty
flying over New York.''

problems with the user's performance, multiple critiques are often produced.
Analysis of a corpus of actual critiques revealed that even though each
individual critique is concise and coherent, the set of critiques as a whole
may exhibit several problems that detract from conciseness and coherence, and
consequently assimilation. Thus a text planner was needed that could integrate
the text plans for individual communicative goals to produce an overall text
plan representing a concise, coherent message.
  This paper presents our general rule-based system for accomplishing this
task. The system takes as input a \emph{set} of individual text plans
represented as RST-style trees, and produces a smaller set of more complex
trees representing integrated messages that still achieve the multiple
communicative goals of the individual text plans. Domain-independent rules are
used to capture strategies across domains, while the facility for addition of
domain-dependent rules enables the system to be tuned to the requirements of a
particular domain. The system has been tested on a corpus of critiques in the
domain of trauma care.

factors and their implications for evaluation. It then argues that this

system that is designed to help foreign language speakers learn standard
English. The system models the grammar of the learner, with this instantiation
of the system tailored to signers of American Sign Language (ASL). We discuss
the theoretical motivations for the system, various difficulties that have been
encountered in the implementation, as well as the methods we have used to
overcome these problems. Our method of capturing ungrammaticalities involves
using mal-rules (also called 'error productions'). However, the straightforward
addition of some mal-rules causes significant performance problems with the
parser. For instance, the ASL population has a strong tendency to drop pronouns
and the auxiliary verb `to be'. Being able to account for these as sentences
results in an explosion in the number of possible parses for each sentence.
This explosion, left unchecked, greatly hampers the performance of the system.
We discuss how this is handled by taking into account expectations from the
specific population (some of which are captured in our unique user model). The
different representations of lexical items at various points in the acquisition
process are modeled by using mal-rules, which obviates the need for multiple
lexicons. The grammar is evaluated on its ability to correctly diagnose
agreement problems in actual sentences produced by ASL native speakers.

phoneme conversion and phoneme connectivity check.
  The morpheme normalization is to replace non-Korean symbols into standard
Korean graphemes. The phrase-break detector assigns phrase breaks using
part-of-speech (POS) information. In the morpheme-to-phoneme conversion module,
each morpheme in the phrase is converted into phonetic patterns by looking up
the morpheme phonetic pattern dictionary which contains candidate phonological
changes in boundaries of the morphemes. Graphemes within a morpheme are grouped
into CCV patterns and converted into phonemes by the CCV conversion rules. The
phoneme connectivity table supports grammaticality checking of the adjacent two
phonetic morphemes.
  In the experiments with a corpus of 4,973 sentences, we achieved 99.9% of the
grapheme-to-phoneme conversion performance and 97.5% of the sentence conversion
performance. The full Korean TTS system is now being implemented using this
conversion method.

spelling correction systems, e.g. ispell, apart from detecting spelling errors,
also assist the user by offering a set of candidate corrections that are close

several guessers, which were combined in different ways. Firstly, we evaluated
all possibilities and selected the best ones in a corpus with artificially
generated typing errors. Secondly, the best combinations were tested on texts
with genuine spelling errors. The results for the latter suggest that we can
expect automatic non-word correction for all the errors in a free running text
with 80% precision and a single proposal 98% of the times (1.02 proposals on
average).

  Theoretical AI (JETAI) special issue on memory-based learning",,,,cmp-lg cs.CL,,"  Recognizing shallow linguistic patterns, such as basic syntactic
relationships between words, is a common task in applied natural language and
text processing. The common practice for approaching this task is by tedious
manual definition of possible pattern structures, often in the form of regular
expressions or finite automata. This paper presents a novel memory-based
learning method that recognizes shallow patterns in new text based on a
bracketed training corpus. The training data are stored as-is, in efficient
suffix-tree data structures. Generalization is performed on-line at recognition
time by comparing subsequences of the new text to positive and negative
evidence in the corpus. This way, no information in the training is lost, as
can happen in other learning systems that construct a single generalized model
at the time of training. The paper presents experimental results for
recognizing noun phrase, subject-verb and verb-object patterns in English.
Since the learning approach enables easy porting to new domains, we plan to
apply it to syntactic patterns in other languages and to sub-language patterns
for information extraction.

hearer's recognition of inferential links to material elsewhere within a
sentence. Textual economy leads to efficient descriptions because the material
that supports such inferences has been included to satisfy independent
communicative goals, and is therefore overloaded in Pollack's sense. We argue
that achieving textual economy imposes strong requirements on the
representation and reasoning used in generating sentences. The representation
must support the generator's simultaneous consideration of syntax and
semantics. Reasoning must enable the generator to assess quickly and reliably
at any stage how the hearer will interpret the current sentence, with its
(incomplete) syntax and semantics. We show that these representational and
reasoning requirements are met in the SPUD system for sentence planning and
realization.

presented and evaluated, one of which is shown to accurately discriminate

method, using WordNet (Miller et al. 1990), produced multiple
cross-classification of articles, primarily due to the bushy nature of the verb
tree coupled with the sense disambiguation problem. Our second approach using
English Verb Classes and Alternations (EVCA) Levin (1993) showed that
monosemous categorization of the frequent verbs in WSJ made it possible to
usefully discriminate documents. For example, our results show that articles in
which communication verbs predominate tend to be opinion pieces, whereas
articles with a high percentage of agreement verbs tend to be about mergers or
legal cases. An evaluation is performed on the results using Kendall's Tau. We
present convincing evidence for using verb semantic classes as a discriminant
in document classification.

improved parsing performance over its non-lexicalized counterpart. Furthermore,
training of PLTIGs displays faster convergence than PCFGs.

suggested that constructing a verse line involves a pattern-matching search
through a source text, and that the number of found elements (complete words
totaling a specified number of syllables) is given by dividing the total number
of words by the mean number of syllables per word in the source text. This
paper makes this latter point explicit mathematically, and in the course of
this demonstration shows that the word length frequency totals in English
output are distributed geometrically (previous researchers reported an adjusted
Poisson distribution), and that the sequential distribution is random at the
global level, with significant non-randomness in the fine structure. Data from
a corpus of just under two million words, and a syllable-count lexicon of
71,000 word-forms is reported. The pattern-matching theory is shown to be
internally coherent, and it is observed that some of the analytic techniques
described here form a satisfactory test for regular (isometric) lineation in a
text.

  Examination of its Character and Consequences",PDF file only,,,,cmp-lg cs.CL,,"  In this paper we build on earlier observations and theory regarding word
length frequency and sequential distribution to develop a mathematical
characterization of some of the language features distinguishing isometrically
lineated text from unlineated text, in other words the features distinguishing
isometrical verse from prose. It is shown that the frequency of syllables
making complete words produces a flat distribution for prose, while that for
verse exhibits peaks at the line length position and subsequent multiples of
that position. Data from several verse authors is presented, including a
detailed mathematical analysis of the dynamics underlying peak creation, and
comments are offered on the processes by which authors construct lines. We note
that the word-length sequence of prose is random, whereas lineation
necessitates non-random word-length sequencing, and that this has the probable
consequence of introducing a degree of randomness into the otherwise highly
ordered grammatical sequence. In addition we observe that this effect can be
ameliorated by a reduction in the mean word length of the text (confirming
earlier observations that verse tends to use shorter words) and the use of
lines varying from the core isometrical set. The frequency of variant lines is
shown to be coincident with the frequency of polysyllables, suggesting that the
use of variant lines is motivated by polysyllabic word placement. The
restrictive effects of different line lengths, the relationship between
metrical restriction and poetic effect, and the general character of metrical
rules are also discussed.

two alignment procedures, one fully automatic and one hand-seeded which produce
reasonable alignments of letters to phones.
  Top Down Induction Tree models are trained on the aligned entries. We show
how combined phoneme/stress prediction is better than separate prediction
processes, and still better when including in the model the last phonemes
transcribed and part of speech information. For the lexicons we have tested,
our models have a word accuracy (including stress) of 78% for OALD, 62% for CMU

substantial size reductions (more than 1/20).

methods in that vectors and operators are expanded into a basis and the
computations take place in this new system of coordinates. However, due to the
recursive definition of wavelets, their controllable localization in both space
and wave number (time and frequency) domains, and the vanishing moments
property, wavelet based algorithms exhibit new and important properties.
  For example, the multiresolution structure of the wavelet expansions brings
about an efficient organization of transformations on a given scale and of
interactions between different neighbouring scales. Moreover, wide classes of
operators which naively would require a full (dense) matrix for their numerical
description, have sparse representations in wavelet bases. For these operators
sparse representations lead to fast numerical algorithms, and thus address a
critical numerical issue.
  We note that wavelet based algorithms provide a systematic generalization of
the Fast Multipole Method (FMM) and its descendents.
  These topics will be the subject of the lecture. Starting from the notion of
multiresolution analysis, we will consider the so-called non-standard form
(which achieves decoupling among the scales) and the associated fast numerical
algorithms. Examples of non-standard forms of several basic operators (e.g.

smooth density function, we obtain the standard reaction-transport equations in

the discrete model can be used to approximate the solutions of the continuum

depends on long-wavelength statistical fluctuations not accounted for by the

Stationary solid particles dissolve with a certain probability and, provided

probability to precipitate. In our simulation of the dissolution of a solid
block inside uniformly flowing water we obtain solid precipitation downstream
from the original solid edge, in contrast to the standard reaction-transport
equations. The observed effect is the result of fluctuations in solute density
and diminishes when we average over a larger ensemble. The additional
precipitation of solid is accompanied by a substantial reduction in the

by the prediction horizon from the model input) in number of bits. This value,
however, is influenced by a method and precision of redundancy estimation and
therefore it is a) normalized by maximum possible redundancy (given by the

of spatially-distributed reacting systems. After introducing the subject within
the wider framework of lattice gas automata (LGA) as a microscopic approach to
the phenomenology of macroscopic systems, we describe the reactive LGA in terms
of a simple physical picture to show how an automaton can be constructed to
capture the essentials of a reactive molecular dynamics scheme. The statistical
mechanical theory of the automaton is then developed for diffusive transport
and for reactive processes, and a general algorithm is presented for reactive
LGA. The method is illustrated by considering applications to bistable and
excitable media, oscillatory behavior in reactive systems, chemical chaos and
pattern formation triggered by Turing bifurcations. The reactive lattice gas
scheme is contrasted with related cellular automaton methods and the paper
concludes with a discussion of future perspectives.

entropy rates (CER's) is presented. The CER's, which are computed from
information-theoretic functionals -- redundancies, are relative measures of
regularity and predictability, and for data generated by dynamical systems they
are related to Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy. A deterministic dynamical origin of
the data under study, however, is not a necessary condition for the use of the
CER's, since the entropy rates can be defined for stochastic processes as well.
Sensitivity of the CER's to changes in data dynamics and their robustness with
respect to noise are tested by using numerically generated time series resulted
from both deterministic -- chaotic and stochastic processes. Potential
application of the CER's in analysis of physiological signals or other complex
time series is demonstrated by using examples from pharmaco-EEG and tremor
classification.

view as to their validity, and point out the necessity of determining the
overall time window length, $\tau_w$, for successful embedding. Emphasis is put
on the relation between $\tau_w$ and the dynamics of the underlying chaotic

$\tau_p$ is approximated from the oscillations of the time series. The
procedure is assessed using the correlation dimension for both synthetic and

always give good results given enough data and thus $\tau_p$ can be considered
as a lower limit ($\tau_w \geq \tau_p$). For noisy synthetic data and real

increasing noise amplitude.

``surrogate'') data for testing hypotheses about a given data set. The first
and more straightforward approach is to fit a single ``best'' model to the
original data, and then to generate surrogate data sets that are ``typical
realizations'' of that model. The second approach concentrates not on the model
but directly on the original data; it attempts to constrain the surrogate data
sets so that they exactly agree with the original data for a specified set of
sample statistics. Examples of these two approaches are provided for two simple
cases: a test for deviations from a gaussian distribution, and a test for
serial dependence in a time series. Additionally, we consider tests for
nonlinearity in time series based on a Fourier transform (FT) method and on
more conventional autoregressive moving-average (ARMA) fits to the data. The
comparative performance of hypothesis testing schemes based on these two
approaches is found to depend on whether or not the discriminating statistic is
pivotal. A statistic is ``pivotal'' if its distribution is the same for all
processes consistent with the null hypothesis. The typical-realization method
requires that the discriminating statistic satisfy this property. The
constrained-realization approach, on the other hand, does not share this
requirement, and can provide an accurate and powerful test without having to
sacrifice flexibility in the choice of discriminating statistic.

methods of Grassberger and Procaccia are applied. A procedure for selection of
the ``meaningful'' scaling region is proposed. Several scaling regions are
revealed in the ln C(r) versus ln r diagram. The first one in the range of
larger ln r has a gradual slope and the second one in the range of intermediate
ln r has a fast slope. Other two regions are settled in the range of small ln
r. The results lead us to claim that the series arises from the activity of at
least two subsystems. The first subsystem is low-dimensional (d_f=1.6) and it
possesses the potential predictability of several weeks. We suggest that this
subsystem is connected with seasonal variability of weather. The second
subsystem is high-dimensional (d_f>17) and its error-doubling time is about 4-7
days. It is found that the predictability differs in dependence on season. The
predictability time for summer, winter and the entire year (T_2 approx. 4.7
days) is longer than for transition-seasons (T_2 approx. 4.0 days for spring,
T_2 approx. 3.6 days for autumn). The role of random noise and the number of

Because of the simplicity of the automaton dynamics, analytical theory can be

The exact equations for the pair correlations are solved explicitly in the
hydrodynamic limit. In this limit, we rigorously derive the results obtained

natural world abounds with locally banded patterns. Such patterns have been of
great interest throughout history, and, in the last twenty years, scientists in
a wide variety of fields have been studying the patterns formed in
well-controlled experiments that yield enormous quantities of high-precision
data. These experiments involving phenomena as diverse as chemical reactions in
shallow layers, thermal convection in horizontal fluid layers, periodically
shaken layers of sand, and the growth of slime mold colonies often display
patterns that appear qualitatively similar. Methods are needed to characterize
in a reasonable amount of time the differences and similarities in patterns
that develop in different systems, as well as in patterns formed in one system
for different experimental conditions. In this Letter, we introduce a novel,
fast method for determining local pattern properties such as wavenumber,
orientation, and curvature as a function of position for locally striped
patterns.

optimal size for the number of neurons in the input layer. The main outcome for
the number of neurons in the input layer. The main outcome of the new approach
for such problems is that to a large extent it defines the ANN architecture and
leads to better predictions. We illustrate our method by considering computer
generated periodic and chaotic time series. The ANN model developed gave
excellent quality of fit for the training and test sets as well as for
iterative dynamic predictions for future values of the two time series.
Further, computer experiments were conducted by introducing Gaussian noise of
various degrees in the two time series, to simulate real world effects. We find
rather surprising results that upto a limit introduction of noise leads to a
smaller network with good generalizing capability.

equations of motion are derived for static, slow flows of incompressible,

section the equations reduce to a perfect discretization of the Poisson
equation for the velocity field with Dirichlet boundary conditions. The perfect

actually conserve the total density, rather than merely classifying it. This is
also the criterion for any CA simulation of DFT. The effect of boundary and
periodicity conditions upon the evolution of such CA are elaborated by
considering linear and cyclic lattices and boundary conditions consistent with
the conservation criterion. In a bounded linear lattice, it is possible to
achieve a configuration with a single 01 and no 10 domain wall, or vice versa,
but this is not possible in a cyclic lattice, where these two domain walls have
to appear in pairs. This determines the final stable state of the automaton.
