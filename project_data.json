We construct an approximation to the\nstochastic flow in the Lie algebra via closed operations and then push back to\nthe Lie group and then to the manifold, thus ensuring our approximation lies in\nthe manifold. We call such schemes stochastic Munthe-Kaas methods after their\ndeterministic counterparts. We also present stochastic Lie group integration\nschemes based on Castell--Gaines methods. These involve using an underlying\nordinary differential integrator to approximate the flow generated by a\ntruncated stochastic exponential Lie series.

The energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be converted\ninto heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. A KINETIC\nCASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space and\nvelocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each of\nthe physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematically\nreduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the \"inertial range\" above the\nion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenic\nfluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisional\nand collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations,\nwhich obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associated\nwith the Alfvenic component. In the \"dissipation range\" between the ion and\nelectron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave\n(KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passive\nphase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings the\nenergy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionless\nwave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in the\nphase space and leads to ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly damped at the\nelectron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. Kolmogorov-style scaling\nrelations are derived for these cascades.

We argue\nthat this is the expected signature of the slow erosion of a mass function that\ninitially rose towards low masses, predominantly through cluster evaporation\ndriven by internal two-body relaxation. We find excellent agreement between the\nobserved GCMF -- including its dependence on internal density rho_h, central\nconcentration c, and Galactocentric distance r_gc -- and a simple model in\nwhich the relaxation-driven mass-loss rates of clusters are approximated by\n-dM/dt = mu_ev ~ rho_h^{1/2}. In particular, we recover the well-known\ninsensitivity of M_TO to r_gc. This feature does not derive from a literal\n``universality'' of the GCMF turnover mass, but rather from a significant\nvariation of M_TO with rho_h -- the expected outcome of relaxation-driven\ncluster disruption -- plus significant scatter in rho_h as a function of r_gc.\nOur conclusions are the same if the evaporation rates are assumed to depend\ninstead on the mean volume or surface densities of clusters inside their tidal\nradii, as mu_ev ~ rho_t^{1/2} or mu_ev ~ Sigma_t^{3/4} -- alternative\nprescriptions that are physically motivated but involve cluster properties\n(rho_t and Sigma_t) that are not as well defined or as readily observable as\nrho_h.

In the context of bosonic string theory we consider on-shell\npp-waves and argue that universality requires the existence of a universal\nsector of world-sheet operators whose correlation functions are insensitive to\nthe pp-wave nature of the metric and the background gauge flux. Such results\ncan also be reproduced using the world-sheet conformal field theory. We also\nstudy such pp-waves in non-polynomial closed string field theory (CSFT).

Because of this\nsimplification it is expected that the off-shell pp-waves can be identified on\nthe two sides. Furthermore, given the massless pp-wave field configurations, an\niterative method for computing the higher massive modes using the CSFT\nequations of motion has been discussed.

For very rapidly rotating black holes (spin\na=J/M>0.9524M) we have found a class of very strong field eccentric orbits\nwhose angular momentum L_z increases with the orbit's inclination with respect\nto the equatorial plane, while keeping latus rectum and eccentricity fixed.\nThis behavior is in contrast with Newtonian intuition, and is in fact opposite\nto the \"normal\" behavior of black hole orbits. Such behavior was noted\npreviously for circular orbits; since it only applies to orbits very close to\nthe black hole, they were named \"nearly horizon-skimming orbits\". Our analysis\ngeneralizes this result, mapping out the full generic (inclined and eccentric)\nfamily of nearly horizon-skimming orbits. The earlier work on circular orbits\nreported that, under gravitational radiation emission, nearly horizon-skimming\norbits tend to evolve to smaller orbit inclination, toward prograde equatorial\nconfiguration. Normal orbits, by contrast, always demonstrate slowly growing\norbit inclination (orbits evolve toward the retrograde equatorial\nconfiguration). Using up-to-date Teukolsky-fluxes, we have concluded that the\nearlier result was incorrect: all circular orbits, including nearly\nhorizon-skimming ones, exhibit growing orbit inclination. Using kludge fluxes\nbased on a Post-Newtonian expansion corrected with fits to circular and to\nequatorial Teukolsky-fluxes, we argue that the inclination grows also for\neccentric nearly horizon-skimming orbits. We also find that the inclination\nchange is, in any case, very small.

It is\nobserved that the six modes are closely related to the low-lying excitations of\nthe system. At finite temperatures, the double-peak structures of the\nsusceptibility and specific heat against temperature are obtained, where the\npeak positions and heights are found to depend on the competition of the\ncouplings. It is also uncovered that the XXZ anisotropy of F and AF couplings\nleads the system of case (c) to display quite different behaviors. In addition,\nthe experimental data of the susceptibility, specific heat and magnetization\nfor the compound Cu$_{3}$(CO$_{3}$)$_{2}$(OH)$_{2}$ are fairly compared with\nour TMRG results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Apr 2007 09:16:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13","authors_parsed":[["Gu","Bo",""],["Su","Gang",""]]},

With beamforming RVQ is asymptotically optimal,\ni.e., no other quantization scheme can achieve a larger asymptotic rate. The\nperformance of RVQ is also compared with that of a simpler reduced-rank scalar\nquantization scheme in which the beamformer is constrained to lie in a random\nsubspace.

The basic principle behind this approach is called the\nflip. In essence, it reduces the negative hypothesis in complexity theory (the\nlower bound problems), such as the P vs. NP problem in characteristic zero, to\nthe positive hypothesis in complexity theory (the upper bound problems):\nspecifically, to showing that the problems of deciding nonvanishing of the\nfundamental structural constants in representation theory and algebraic\ngeometry, such as the well known plethysm constants--or rather certain relaxed\nforms of these decision probelms--belong to the complexity class P. In this\narticle, we suggest a plan for implementing the flip, i.e., for showing that\nthese relaxed decision problems belong to P. This is based on the reduction of\nthe preceding complexity-theoretic positive hypotheses to mathematical\npositivity hypotheses: specifically, to showing that there exist positive\nformulae--i.e. formulae with nonnegative coefficients--for the structural\nconstants under consideration and certain functions associated with them. These\nturn out be intimately related to the similar positivity properties of the\nKazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and the multiplicative structural constants of the\ncanonical (global crystal) bases in the theory of Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum\ngroups. The known proofs of these positivity properties depend on the Riemann\nhypothesis over finite fields and the related results. Thus the reduction here,\nin conjunction with the flip, in essence, says that the validity of the P vs.\nNP conjecture in characteristic zero is intimately linked to the Riemann\nhypothesis over finite fields and related problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Apr 2007 16:41:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 May 2007 19:55:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 28 Apr 2008 19:49:27 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 22 Jan 2009 15:25:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-22","authors_parsed":[["Mulmuley","Ketan D.",""]]},

X-ray observations reveal a bullet-like subcluster\nwith a prominent bow shock, while lensing results show that the positions of\nthe total mass peaks are consistent with the centroids of the collisionless\ngalaxies (and inconsistent with the X-ray brightness peaks). Previous studies,\nbased on older observational datasets, have placed upper limits on the\nself-interaction cross-section of dark matter per unit mass, sigma/m, using\nsimplified analytic techniques. In this work, we take advantage of new,\nhigher-quality observational datasets by running N-body simulations of\n1E0657-56 that include the effects of self-interacting dark matter, and\ncomparing the results with observations. Furthermore, the recent data allow for\na new independent method of constraining sigma/m, based on the non-observation\nof an offset between the bullet subcluster mass peak and galaxy centroid. This\nnew method places an upper limit (68% confidence) of sigma/m < 1.25 cm^2/g.

Aims: This motivates planet searches around\nstars which are significantly more massive or less massive than the Sun, and in\nparticular our radial velocity search for planets around very-low mass stars.\nMethods: As part of that program, we obtained measurements of GJ 674, an M2.5\ndwarf at d=4.5 pc, which have a dispersion much in excess of their internal\nerrors. An intensive observing campaign demonstrates that the excess dispersion\nis due to two superimposed coherent signals, with periods of 4.69 and 35 days.\nResults: These data are well described by a 2-planet Keplerian model where each\nplanet has a ~11 Mearth minimum mass. A careful analysis of the (low level)\nmagnetic activity of GJ 674 however demonstrates that the 35-day period\ncoincides with the stellar rotation period. This signal therefore originates in\na spot inhomogeneity modulated by stellar rotation. The 4.69-day signal on the\nother hand is caused by a bona-fide planet, GJ 674b.

Based on this simulation, we suggest that the central\nregion of the merger remnant can, once it has reached quasi-static equilibrium,\nbe approximated as a differentially rotating CO star, which consists of a\nslowly rotating cold core and a rapidly rotating hot envelope surrounded by a\ncentrifugally supported disc. We construct a model of the CO remnant that\nmimics the results of the SPH simulation using a one-dimensional hydrodynamic\nstellar evolution code and then follow its secular evolution. The stellar\nevolution models indicate that the growth of the cold core is controlled by\nneutrino cooling at the interface between the core and the hot envelope, and\nthat carbon ignition in the envelope can be avoided despite high effective\naccretion rates. This result suggests that the assumption of forced accretion\nof cold matter that was adopted in previous studies of the evolution of double\nCO white dwarf merger remnants may not be appropriate. Our results imply that\nat least some products of double CO white dwarfs merger may be considered good\ncandidates for the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae.

The star is a G type dwarf located at a distance of 46 pc with age\nestimation between 20 and 300 Myrs. We carried out spectroscopic observations\nof this star with FEROS at the 2.2 m MPG/ESO telescope at La Silla. Our\nspectroscopic analysis yields a spectral type of G1-1.5V and an age of about\n100 Myrs. Variations in stellar radial velocity of HD 70573 have been monitored\nsince December 2003 until January 2007. The velocity accuracy of FEROS within\nthis period is about 10 m/s. HD 70573 shows a radial velocity variation with a\nperiod of 852 +/- 12 days and a semi-amplitude of 149 +/- 6 m/s. The period of\nthis variation is significantly longer than its rotational period, which is 3.3\ndays. Based on the analysis of the Ca II K emission line, Halpha and Teff\nvariation as stellar activity indicators as well as the lack of a correlation\nbetween the bisector velocity span and the radial velocity, we can exclude the\nrotational modulation and non-radial pulsations as the source of the\nlong-period radial velocity variation. Thus, the presence of a low-mass\ncompanion around the star provides the best explanation for the observed radial\nvelocity variation.

The skeletons are\ncomposed of elastic linear-chains and rigid junctions and form a\ncompartmentalized structure on the surface, and for this reason the vertices of\ntriangles can diffuse freely only inside the compartments. As a consequence, an\ninhomogeneous structure is introduced in the model; the surface strength inside\nthe compartments is different from the surface strength on the compartments.\nHowever, the rotational symmetry is not influenced by the elastic skeletons;\nthere is no specific direction on the surface. In addition to the three phases\nmentioned above, a collapsed phase is expected to exist in the low bending\nrigidity regime that was not studied here. The inhomogeneous structure and the\nfluidity of vertices are considered to be the origin of such variety of phases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Apr 2007 04:53:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13","authors_parsed":[["Koibuchi","Hiroshi",""]]},

We\nestimate the white dwarf's magnetic moment to be mu(WD) \\approx 2 x 10^33 G\ncm^3, which is not only similar to three of the other four confirmed\nshort-period IPs but also to those of many of the long-period IPs. We suggest\nthat long-period IPs conserve their magnetic moment as they evolve towards\nshorter orbital periods. Therefore the dominant population of long-period IPs,\nwhich have white dwarf spin periods roughly ten times shorter than their\norbital periods, will likely end up as short-period IPs like SDSS J2333, with\nspin periods a large fraction of their orbital periods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Apr 2007 08:18:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26","authors_parsed":[["Southworth","John","","1 and 3"],["Gaensicke","B.

The\nSiO(8-7) emission outlines likely two molecular outflows emanating from this\nhot core region.

Fortunately, by properly selecting routes near the\ngateway (or by properly positioning the relay nodes leading to the gateway) to\nfashion after the structure of canonical networks, the throughput can be\nimproved significantly by more than 150%.

With an internal symmetry group $G$ having $D$ generators\nnot only the pure Lorentz symmetry SO(1,3), but the larger accidental symmetry\n$SO(D,3D)$ of the SLIV constraint in itself appears to be spontaneously broken\nas well. As a result, while the pure Lorentz violation still generates only one\ngenuine Goldstone vector boson, the accompanying pseudo-Goldstone vector bosons\nrelated to the $SO(D,3D)$ breaking also come into play in the final arrangement\nof the entire Goldstone vector field multiplet. Remarkably, they remain\nstrictly massless, being protected by gauge invariance of the Yang-Mills theory\ninvolved. We show that, although this theory contains a plethora of Lorentz and\n$CPT$ violating couplings, they do not lead to physical SLIV effects which turn\nout to be strictly cancelled in all the lowest order processes considered.\nHowever, the physical Lorentz violation could appear if the internal gauge\ninvariance were slightly broken at very small distances influenced by gravity.\nFor the SLIV scale comparable with the Planck one the Lorentz violation could\nbecome directly observable at low energies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Apr 2007 11:58:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 May 2007 14:42:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 24 May 2007 22:08:53 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 14 Jun 2007 01:34:42 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sat, 15 Sep 2007 05:40:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26","authors_parsed":[["Chkareuli","J.

We further show how to exactly\nrepresent the CF wavefunctions in the Jain series $\\nu = s/(2sp+1)$ as the CFT\ncorrelators of a new type of fermionic vertex operators, $V_{p,n}(z)$,\nconstructed from $n$ free compactified bosons; these operators provide the CFT\nrepresentation of composite fermions carrying $2p$ flux quanta in the $n^{\\rm\nth}$ CF Landau level. We also construct the corresponding quasiparticle- and\nquasihole operators and argue that they have the expected fractional charge and\nstatistics. For filling fractions 2/5 and 3/7 we show that the chiral CFTs that\ndescribe the bulk wave functions are identical to those given by Wen's general\nclassification of quantum Hall states in terms of $K$-matrices and $l$- and\n$t$-vectors, and we propose that to be generally true. Our results suggest a\ngeneral procedure for constructing quasiparticle wave functions for other\nfractional Hall states, as well as for constructing ground states at filling\nfractions not contained in the principal Jain series.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Apr 2007 13:27:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29","authors_parsed":[["Hansson","Hans",""],["Chang","Chia-Chen",""],["Jain","Jainendra",""],["Viefers","Susanne",""]]},

We find that\nthe outflows tend to escape to low density regions, and hardly affect the dense\nfilaments visible in HI absorption. As a result, the strength of HI absorption\nnear galaxies is not reduced by galactic winds, but even slightly increases. We\nalso find that a lack of HI absorption for lines of sight (LOS) close to\ngalaxies, as found by Adelberger et al., can be created by hot gas around the\ngalaxies induced by accretion shock heating. In contrast to HI, metal\nabsorption systems are sensitive to the presence of winds. The models without\nfeedback can produce the strong CIV and OVI absorption lines in LOS within 50\nkpc from galaxies, while strong SN feedback is capable of creating strong CIV\nand OVI lines out to about twice that distance. We also analyze the mean\ntransmissivity of HI, CIV, and OVI within 1 h$^{-1}$ Mpc from star-forming\ngalaxies. The probability distribution of the transmissivity of HI is\nindependent of the strength of SN feedback, but strong feedback produces LOS\nwith lower transmissivity of metal lines.

The ccbar pairs are produced in the initial collision and in the\npartonic system during the prethermal and thermal stages through the partonic\nchannels ab to ccbar [{2S+1}L_J] and ab to ccbar [{2S+1}L_J]x, and then they\ndissociate in the latter two stages.

There are\nmodest yields of ccbar in the prethermal stage at RHIC energy and through the\nreactions ab to ccbar [{2S+1}L_J] at LHC energy for partons with large average\nmomentum in the prethermal stage at both collider energies and in the thermal\nstage at LHC energy.

Neishtadt and Sinai previously pointed\nout that an averaging theorem due to Anosov should extend to this situation.\n  When $ d=1$, the gas particles move in just one dimension, and we prove that\nthe rate of convergence of the actual motions of the piston to its averaged\nbehavior is $\\mathcal{O} (M^ {-1/2}) $ on the time scale $M^ {1/2} $. The\nconvergence is uniform over all initial conditions in a compact set. We also\ninvestigate the piston system when the particle interactions have been\nsmoothed. The convergence to the averaged behavior again takes place uniformly,\nboth over initial conditions and over the amount of smoothing.\n  In addition, we prove generalizations of our results to $N$ pistons\nseparating $N+1$ gas chambers. We also provide a general discussion of\naveraging theory and the proofs of a number of previously known averaging\nresults. In particular, we include a new proof of Anosov's averaging theorem\nfor smooth systems that is primarily due to Dolgopyat.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Apr 2007 09:41:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23","authors_parsed":[["Wright","Paul",""]]},

The observed SEDs are\nmodeled using a combination of an elliptical template and torus emission (using\nthe phenomenological templates of Silva et al. 2004) for six sources associated\nwith passive galaxies; for two point-like sources, the empirical SEDs of red\nquasars are adopted. The bolometric luminosities and the M_BH-L_K relation are\nused to provide an estimate of the masses and Eddington ratios of the black\nholes residing in these AGN.\n  Results: All of our sources are detected in the IRAC and MIPS (at 24 micron)\nbands.

Remarkably,\nentanglement can be \"swapped\": if one prepares two independent entangled pairs\nA1-A2 and B1-B2, a joint measurement on A1 and B1 (called a \"Bell-State\nMeasurement\", BSM) has the effect of projecting A2 and B2 onto an entangled\nstate, although these two particles have never interacted or shared any common\npast[1,2]. Experiments using twin photons produced by spontaneous parametric\ndown-conversion (SPDC) have already demonstrated entanglement swapping[3-6],\nbut here we present its first realization using continuous wave (CW) sources,\nas originally proposed[2]. The challenge was to achieve sufficiently sharp\nsynchronization of the photons in the BSM. Using narrow-band filters, the\ncoherence time of the photons that undergo the BSM is significantly increased,\nexceeding the temporal resolution of the detectors. Hence pulsed sources can be\nreplaced by CW sources, which do not require any synchronization[6,7], allowing\nfor the first time the use of completely autonomous sources.

High critical density lines trace regions with similar\nphysical properties across galaxy types, and this produces a linear correlation\nbetween line luminosity and star formation rate. Low critical density lines\nprobe regions whose properties vary across galaxies, leading to a star\nformation rate that varies superlinearly with line luminosity.

We also present colour-colour diagrams for use as diagnostic\ntools in the study of elliptical galaxies. The model has major implications for\nunderstanding the evolution of the UV excess and of elliptical galaxies in\ngeneral.

Due to the asymmetric topology, the synchronous patterns formed\nin complex networks are irregular and nonstationary. For coupling strength\nimmediately out of the synchronizable region, the typical phenomenon is the\non-off intermittency of the system dynamics. The patterns appeared in this\nprocess are signatured by the coexistence of a giant cluster, which comprises\nmost of the nodes, and a few number of small clusters. The pattern evolution is\ncharacterized by the giant cluster irregularly absorbs or emits the small\nclusters. As the coupling strength leaves away from the synchronization\nbifurcation point, the giant cluster is gradually dissolved into a number of\nsmall clusters, and the system dynamics is characterized by the integration and\nseparation of the small clusters. Dynamical mechanisms and statistical\nproperties of the nonstationary pattern evolution are analyzed and conducted,\nand some scalings are newly revealed. Remarkably, it is found that the few\nactive nodes, which escape from the giant cluster with a high frequency, are\nindependent of the coupling strength while are sensitive to the bifurcation\ntypes.

The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is usually a main factor in\ndetermining the probability of error (or of communication failure) in a link.\nThese probabilities are then a proxy for the SNR under which the links operate.\nThe paper studies the problem of designing the topology, i.e., assigning the\nprobabilities of reliable communication among sensors (or of link failures) to\nmaximize the rate of convergence of average consensus, when the link\ncommunication costs are taken into account, and there is an overall\ncommunication budget constraint. To consider this problem, we address a number\nof preliminary issues: (1) model the network as a random topology; (2)\nestablish necessary and sufficient conditions for mean square sense (mss) and\nalmost sure (a.s.) convergence of average consensus when network links fail;\nand, in particular, (3) show that a necessary and sufficient condition for both\nmss and a.s. convergence is for the algebraic connectivity of the mean graph\ndescribing the network topology to be strictly positive. With these results, we\nformulate topology design, subject to random link failures and to a\ncommunication cost constraint, as a constrained convex optimization problem to\nwhich we apply semidefinite programming techniques. We show by an extensive\nnumerical study that the optimal design improves significantly the convergence\nspeed of the consensus algorithm and can achieve the asymptotic performance of\na non-random network at a fraction of the communication cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Apr 2007 21:58:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13","authors_parsed":[["Kar","Soummya",""],["Moura","Jose M.

Its\nneutrino signal is a valuable diagnostic of its internal structure and\ncomposition. During its transformation from a hot, lepton-rich to a cold,\ncatalyzed remnant, the possibility exists that it can collapse into a black\nhole, which abruptly terminates neutrino emissions. The essential microphysics,\nreviewed herein, that controls its evolution are the equation of state of dense\nmatter and its associated neutrino opacities. Several simulations of the\nproto-neutron star evolution, involving different assumptions about the\ncomposition of dense matter, are described.

Consequently, the first stars created in small\nearly-forming galaxies are less metal-rich that the first stars formed in more\nmassive galaxies which typically form later. As most halo stars are likely to\noriginate in accreted dwarfs, while disk stars formed out of outflow-enriched\ngas, this scenario naturally generates a ``metallicity floor'' for old disk\nstars, which we find to be roughly coincident with the higher end of our\npredicted metallicity distribution of halo stars, in agreement with\nobservations. The broad and centrally peaked distribution of halo star\nmetallicities is well reproduced in our models, with a natural dispersion\ndepending on the exact accretion history. Our modeling includes the important\n``baryonic stripping'' effect of early outflows, which brush away the tenuously\nheld gas in neighboring pre-virialized density perturbations. This stripping\nprocess does not significantly modify the predicted shape of the halo star\nmetal distribution but inhibits star-formation and hence the number of accreted\nstars, helping to reproduce the observed total Galactic halo luminosity and\nalso the lack of low-luminosity local dwarf galaxies relative to N-body\npredictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Dec 2000 01:03:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Feb 2001 06:33:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31","authors_parsed":[["Scannapieco","Evan",""],["Broadhurst","Tom",""]]},

Its X-ray spectrum is well fitted with a power law with\nalpha = 0.60 +/- 0.05. Combining this measurement with lower frequency data\nshows that a pure synchrotron model can fit the spectrum of this knot from\n1.647 GHz to 5 keV (over nine decades in energy) with alpha = 0.76 +/- 0.02,\nsimilar to the X-ray spectral slope. Thus, we place a lower limit on the total\npower radiated by this knot of 1.5e43 erg/s; substantially more power may be\nemitted in the hard X-ray and gamma-ray bands.\n  Knot A2 is also detected and is somewhat blended with knot B1. Synchrotron\nemission may also explain the X-ray emission but a spectral bend is required\nnear the optical band. For knots A1 and B1, the X-ray flux dominates the\nemitted energy. For the remaining optical knots (C through H), localized X-ray\nenhancements that might correspond to the optical features are not clearly\nresolved.

At z=0.888 and L_X=1.1e45 erg/s (0.5-2.0\nkeV, h_0=0.5) ClJ1226.9+3332 is the most distant X-ray luminous cluster\ncurrently known. The mere existence of this system represents a huge problem\nfor Omega_0=1 world models.\n  At the modest (off-axis) resolution of the ROSAT PSPC observation in which\nthe system was detected, ClJ1226.9+3332 appears relaxed; an off-axis HRI\nobservation confirms this impression and rules out significant contamination\nfrom point sources. However, in moderately deep optical images (R and I band)\nthe cluster exhibits signs of substructure in its apparent galaxy distribution.\nA first crude estimate of the velocity dispersion of the cluster galaxies based\non six redshifts yields a high value of 1650 km/s, indicative of a very massive\ncluster and/or the presence of substructure along the line of sight. While a\nmore accurate assessment of the dynamical state of this system requires much\nbetter data at both optical and X-ray wavelengths, the high mass of the cluster\nhas already been unambiguously confirmed by a very strong detection of the\nSunyaev-Zel'dovich effect in its direction (Joy et al. 2001).\n  Using ClJ1226.9+3332 and ClJ0152.7-1357 (z=0.835), the second-most distant\nX-ray luminous cluster currently known and also a WARPS discovery, we obtain a\nfirst estimate of the cluster X-ray luminosity function at 0.8<z<1.4 and\nL_X>5e44 erg/s. Using the best currently available data, we find the comoving\nspace density of very distant, massive clusters to be in excellent agreement\nwith the value measured locally (z<0.3), and conclude that negative evolution\nis not required at these luminosities out to z~1.

I\ndiscuss a number of challenges faced by theoretical models, in order to\nidentify open questions in accretion physics that need to be addressed.\nFinally, I discuss the relation to and implications for variability models of\nthe detection of nearly coherent oscillations during type I X-ray bursts in\nseveral neutron-star sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Dec 2000 00:48:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31","authors_parsed":[["Psaltis","Dimitrios","","MIT"]]},

Since the\nefficiency of this process decreases with increasing particle number, it causes\nthe lifetimes not to scale with the relaxation time. Analytic formulae are\nderived for the scaling of the lifetimes in the different cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Dec 2000 21:38:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-31","authors_parsed":[["Baumgardt","H.","","Edinburgh"]]},

Numerical simulations of\ngalaxy formation in Cold Dark Matter (CDM) dominated universes indicate that\nthe slope and scatter of the I-band Tully-Fisher (TF) relation are well\nreproduced in this model, although not, as proposed in recent work, because of\nthe cosmological equivalence between halo mass and circular velocity, but\nrather as a result of the dynamical response of the halo to the assembly of the\nluminous component of the galaxy. The zero-point of the TF relation is\ndetermined mainly by the stellar mass-to-light ratio ($\\Upsilon_I$) as well as\nby the concentration ($c$) of the dark halo. For $c \\sim 10$, as is typical of\nhalos formed in the ``concordance'' $\\Lambda$CDM model, we find that this\nrequires $\\Upsilon_I \\sim 1.5$, in reasonable agreement with the mass-to-light\nratios expected of stellar populations with colors similar to those of TF\ngalaxies.

It is found\nthat dark halo concentrations depend on the amplitude of mass fluctuations as\nwell as on the ratio of power between small and virial mass scales. This\nfinding is consistent with the original results of Navarro, Frenk & White\n(NFW), and allows their model to be extended to include power spectra\nsubstantially different from Cold Dark Matter (CDM). In particular, the\nsingle-parameter model presented here fits the concentration dependence on halo\nmass for truncated power spectra, such as those expected in the warm dark\nmatter scenario, and predicts a stronger redshift dependence for the\nconcentration of CDM halos than proposed by NFW. The latter conclusion confirms\nrecent suggestions by Bullock et al., although this new modeling differs from\ntheirs in detail.

The radiation flux\navoids the regions of high density, which are therefore weighed down by\ngravity, while gas in the low-density regions is slammed upward into the shock\nfronts by radiation force. As the wave pattern moves through the atmosphere,\neach parcel of matter alternately experiences upward and downward forces, which\nbalance on average. Magnetic tension shares the competing forces between\nregions of different densities, preventing the atmosphere from blowing apart.\nWe calculate the density structure and phase speed of the wave pattern, and\nrelate these to the wavelength, the density contrast, and the factor by which\nthe net radiation flux exceeds the Eddington limit. In principle, this factor\ncan be as large as the ratio of magnetic pressure to mean gas pressure, or the\nratio of radiation pressure to gas pressure, whichever is smaller.

Dust undergo radial migration,\nseeking a stable equilibrium orbit in corotation with gas. The migration of\ndust gives rise to radial fractionation of dust and creates a variety of\npossible observed disk morphologies, which we compute by considering the\nequilibrium between the dust production and the dust-dust collisions removing\nparticles from their equilibrium orbits. Sand-sized and larger grains are\ndistributed throughout most of the gas disk, with concentration near the gas\npressure maximum in the inner disk. Smaller grains (typically in the range of\n10 to 200 micron) concentrate in a prominent ring structure in the outer region\nof the gas disk (presumably at radius 100 AU), where gas density is rapidly\ndeclining with radius.

Previous\ntheoretical work on the resonant capture of particles into mean-motion\nresonances by orbital migration has been restricted to the study of integrable\nmodels. By exploring toy drifting Hamiltonian models we illustrate how the\nstructure in phase space of a resonance can be used to generalize this\nintegrable capture theory to include the richer phenomenology of chaotic\nresonances. We show that particles are temporarily captured into the chaotic\nzone of a resonance with fixed shape for a time that is given by the width of\nthe chaotic zone divided by the resonance drift rate. Particles can be\npermanently captured into a drifting chaotic resonance only if they are\ncaptured into a growing integrable region. Therefore resonances containing wide\nchaotic zones have lower permanent capture probabilities than those lacking\nchaotic zones. We expect large deviations from the predictions of integrable\ncapture theories when the chaotic zone is large and the migration rate is\nsufficiently long that many Lyapunov times pass while particles are temporarily\ncaptured in the resonance. The 2:1 mean-motion resonance with Neptune in the\nKuiper Belt contains a chaotic zone, even when integrated on short timescales\nsuch as a million years. Capture probabilities are lower than estimated\npreviously from drifting integrable models. This may offer an explanation for\nlow eccentricity Kuiper Belt objects between 45-47 AU which should have been\npreviously captured in the 2:1 resonance by Neptune's migration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Dec 2000 21:37:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Dec 2000 02:00:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23","authors_parsed":[["Quillen","A.

If the black hole rotates faster than the\ndisk, energy and angular momentum are extracted from the black hole and\ntransfered to the disk. The energy deposited into the disk is eventually\nradiated away by the disk, which will increase the efficiency of the disk. If\nthe black hole rotates slower than the disk, energy and angular momentum are\ntransfered from the disk to the black hole, which will lower the efficiency of\nthe disk.

Most of\nthe discrete sources associated with the galaxy appear to be low mass X-ray\nbinaries (LMXBs). The luminosity function of the LMXB sources is well-fit by a\nbroken power-law with a break luminosity comparable to the Eddington luminosity\nfor a 1.4 solar mass neutron star.

The diffuse\nemission is predominately soft while the emission from the sources is mostly\nhard.

The main scientific goals were to investigate the nature of the young\nstellar objects (YSOs) in the cluster, and to examine the efficiency of\ndetecting circumstellar disk sources from near-infrared JHKL color-color\ndiagrams. Out of 59 sources surveyed having K-band magnitudes K < 10.5, we\ndetected 35 (~59%) at 10 um.

This has been explained by the presence of a distant third star\nin the system, which has now been detected spectroscopically with a period of\n679 days. The plane of the orbit of the binary is changing relative to the line\nof sight in response to perturbations from this third object. A recent analysis\nby Milone et al.

Our use of\na much improved ephemeris for the system by Torres & Stefanik was found to be\ncrucial, and prompted us to re-determine all the amplitudes from the historical\ndata at our disposal, including the Harvard material used by M00.\nSystematically lower measurements on the branches of the minima were properly\naccounted for, and we made use of both a linear approximation to the time\nvariation of the inclination angle and a more realistic model based on the\ntheory of three-body interactions (\"regression of the nodes\" effect). The nodal\ncycle is found to be about 600 yr, within which TWO eclipse \"seasons\" occur,\neach lasting about 100 yr.

Attention is focused on the\noccurrence of hydrogen shell flashes induced by diffusion processes during\ncooling phases. Initial models from 0.406 to 0.161 solar masses are constructed\nby applying mass loss rates at different stages of the RGB evolution of a solar\nmodel. The multicomponent flow equations describing gravitational settling, and\nchemical and thermal diffusion are solved and the diffusion calculations are\ncoupled to an evolutionary code. In addition, the same sequences are computed\nbut neglecting diffusion. We find that element diffusion strongly affects the\nstructure and cooling history of helium WD. In particular, diffusion induces\nthe occurrence of hydrogen shell flashes in models with masses ranging from\n0.18 to 0.41 solar masses, which is in sharp contrast from the situation when\ndiffusion is neglected. In connection with the further evolution, these\ndiffusion-induced flashes lead to much thinner hydrogen envelopes, preventing\nstable nuclear burning from being an appreciable energy source at advanced\nstages of evolution. This implies much shorter cooling ages than in the case\nwhen diffusion is neglected. These new WD models are discussed in light of\nrecent observational data of some millisecond pulsar systems with WD\ncompanions. We find that age discrepancies between the predictions of standard\nevolutionary models and such observations appear to be the result of ignoring\nelement diffusion in such models.

This method might,\nhowever, degrade classification results, since the distributions it employs are\nnot always precise enough for representing the differences between categories.\nWe propose here the use of soft clustering of words, i.e., in which a word can\nbe assigned to several different clusters and each cluster is characterized by\na specific word probability distribution. We define for each document category\na finite mixture model, which is a linear combination of the probability\ndistributions of the clusters. We thereby treat the problem of classifying\ndocuments as that of conducting statistical hypothesis testing over finite\nmixture models. In order to accomplish this testing, we employ the EM algorithm\nwhich helps efficiently estimate parameters in a finite mixture model.\nExperimental results indicate that our method outperforms not only the method\nusing distributions based on hard clustering, but also the method using\nword-based distributions and the method based on cosine-similarity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 May 1997 05:03:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03","authors_parsed":[["Li","Hang","","C&C Res.

Regular expressions are passed\ndirectly to a Perl CGI program, enabling the full flexibility of Perl extended\nregular expressions. The regular expression notation is extended to better\nsupport phonological searches, such as search for minimal pairs. Search results\nare presented in the form of HTML or LaTeX tables, where each cell is either a\nnumber (representing frequency) or a designated subset of the fields. Tables\nhave up to four dimensions, with an elegant system for specifying which\nfragments of which fields should be used for the row/column labels. The tool\noffers several advantages over traditional methods of analysis: (i) it supports\na quantitative method of doing phonological research; (ii) it gives universal\naccess to the same set of informants; (iii) it enables other researchers to\nhear the original speech data without having to rely on published\ntranscriptions; (iv) it makes the full power of regular expression search\navailable, and search results are full multimedia documents; and (v) it enables\nthe early refutation of false hypotheses, shortening the\nanalysis-hypothesis-test loop. A life-size application to an African tone\nlanguage (Dschang) is used for exemplification throughout the paper. The\ndatabase contains 2200 records, each with approximately 15 fields.

In this chapter, I argue that the restriction of centering to\noperating within a discourse segment should be abandoned in order to integrate\ncentering with a model of global discourse structure. The within-segment\nrestriction causes three problems. The first problem is that centers are often\ncontinued over discourse segment boundaries with pronominal referring\nexpressions whose form is identical to those that occur within a discourse\nsegment. The second problem is that recent work has shown that listeners\nperceive segment boundaries at various levels of granularity. If centering\nmodels a universal processing phenomenon, it is implausible that each listener\nis using a different centering algorithm.The third issue is that even for\nutterances within a discourse segment, there are strong contrasts between\nutterances whose adjacent utterance within a segment is hierarchically recent\nand those whose adjacent utterance within a segment is linearly recent. This\nchapter argues that these problems can be eliminated by replacing Grosz and\nSidner's stack model of attentional state with an alternate model, the cache\nmodel. I show how the cache model is easily integrated with the centering\nalgorithm, and provide several types of data from naturally occurring\ndiscourses that support the proposed integrated model. Future work should\nprovide additional support for these claims with an examination of a larger\ncorpus of naturally occurring discourses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Aug 1997 21:13:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03","authors_parsed":[["Walker","Marilyn A.",""]]},

In natural language,\ncontext is constructed by the speaker and the interpreter, and both have\nconsiderable discretion in so doing. Therefore, a formalization based on\npre-defined contexts and pre-defined `lifting axioms' cannot account for how\ncontext is used in real-world language.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Dec 1997 20:49:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23","authors_parsed":[["Hirst","Graeme","","University of Toronto"]]},

Unlike\nprevious treatments of optimality in computational linguistics, starting with\nEllison (1994), the new approach does not require any explicit marking and\ncounting of constraint violations. It is based on the notion of \"lenient\ncomposition,\" defined as the combination of ordinary composition and priority\nunion. If an underlying form has outputs that can meet a given constraint,\nlenient composition enforces the constraint; if none of the output candidates\nmeet the constraint, lenient composition allows all of them.

Such tasks include machine\ntranslation, information retrieval, parsing, natural language understanding and\nlexicography. Reflecting the growth in utilization of machine readable texts,\nword sense disambiguation techniques have been explored variously in the\ncontext of corpus-based approaches. Within one corpus-based framework, that is\nthe similarity-based method, systems use a database, in which example sentences\nare manually annotated with correct word senses. Given an input, systems search\nthe database for the most similar example to the input. The lexical ambiguity\nof a word contained in the input is resolved by selecting the sense annotation\nof the retrieved example. In this research, we apply this method of resolution\nof verbal polysemy, in which the similarity between two examples is computed as\nthe weighted average of the similarity between complements governed by a target\npolysemous verb. We explore similarity-based verb sense disambiguation focusing\non the following three methods. First, we propose a weighting schema for each\nverb complement in the similarity computation. Second, in similarity-based\ntechniques, the overhead for manual supervision and searching the large-sized\ndatabase can be prohibitive. To resolve this problem, we propose a method to\nselect a small number of effective examples, for system usage.

Data from several verse authors is presented, including a\ndetailed mathematical analysis of the dynamics underlying peak creation, and\ncomments are offered on the processes by which authors construct lines. We note\nthat the word-length sequence of prose is random, whereas lineation\nnecessitates non-random word-length sequencing, and that this has the probable\nconsequence of introducing a degree of randomness into the otherwise highly\nordered grammatical sequence. In addition we observe that this effect can be\nameliorated by a reduction in the mean word length of the text (confirming\nearlier observations that verse tends to use shorter words) and the use of\nlines varying from the core isometrical set. The frequency of variant lines is\nshown to be coincident with the frequency of polysyllables, suggesting that the\nuse of variant lines is motivated by polysyllabic word placement.

The MPPC project\nstarted in 1990 in the heydeys of parallelism and produced four ASTRA machines\n(presented at CHEP'92) with 4k processors (which are expandable to 16k) based\non `yesterday's chip-technology' (chip presented at CHEP'91). These machines\nnow provide excellent test-beds for algorithmic developments in a complete,\nreal environment. We are developing for example fast-pattern recognition\nalgorithms which could be used in high-energy physics experiments at the LHC\n(planned to be operational after 2004 at CERN) for triggering and data\nreduction. The basic feature of our ASP (Associative String Processor) approach\nis to use extremely simple (thus very cheap) processor elements but in huge\nquantities (up to millions of processors) connected together by a very simple\nstring-like communication chain. In this paper we present powerful algorithms\nbased on this architecture indicating the performance perspectives if the\nhardware (i.e. chip fabrication) quality reaches `present or even future\ntechnology levels'.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Oct 1995 12:32:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Oct 1995 14:19:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 6 Oct 1995 08:49:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03","authors_parsed":[["Odor","G.",""],["Rohrbach","F.",""],["Vesztergombi","G.",""],["Varga","G.",""],["Tatrai","F.",""]]},

The second approach concentrates not on the model\nbut directly on the original data; it attempts to constrain the surrogate data\nsets so that they exactly agree with the original data for a specified set of\nsample statistics.

In this way, we show that it is possible to achieve variable\n(albeit density-dependent) Prandtl number even within a single-relaxation-time\nlattice-BGK model. We accomplish this by demanding analyticity of the third\nmoments and traces of the fourth moments of the equilibrium distribution\nfunction. The method of derivation demonstrates that certain undesirable\nfeatures of the model -- such as the unphysical dependence of the viscosity\ncoefficients on temperature -- cannot be corrected within the scope of\nlattice-BGK models with constant relaxation time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Oct 1998 14:23:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24","authors_parsed":[["Boghosian","Bruce M.","","Boston University"],["Coveney","Peter V.","","Schlumberger Cambridge Research"]]},
